Nov 14 01:34:05 .:debdrup:.	Oh, huh. The LINUX value in the Makefile is part of the OPTIONS_DEFAULT environment variable - so that might not even be necessary?
Nov 14 01:34:32 .:debdrup:.	Assuming the Linuxulator is new enough for Steam/Proton, it might work.
Nov 14 01:50:03 .:antranigv:.	I added a feature like this https://bsd.network/@antranigv/109338809826149752 ; any feedback before I push? it uses column(1) in service(8), does anyone know if that's allowed? also, should I add coloring or is that too much?
Nov 14 01:50:07 .:VimDiesel:.	Title: Antranig Vartanian: "`service -s`, a silly feature, but I like it. Th…" - BSD Network
Nov 14 01:55:41 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	I'd keep coloring a not-default option, personally.
Nov 14 01:58:58 .:_xor:.	Where do those 1-line sysctl variable descriptions come from? Are they directly defined in the source tree or is there a separate location for them that sysctl looks up? (will look at the source later, but if anyone knows off-hand, it could save me some time)
Nov 14 02:00:51 .:debdrup:.	antranigv: I like it, and I think V_PauAmma_V has a point about coloring being a second option
Nov 14 02:01:05 .:debdrup:.	_xor: the ones from the -d flag?
Nov 14 02:03:37 .:debdrup:.	antranigv: columnating something in (Almquist) shell without using column(1) seems like a lot of effort though, so I think using a standard POSIX utility is fine.
Nov 14 02:05:20 .:antranigv:.	debdrup thanks for the feedback, I was worried. lemme post the code as well, I'd love your feedback
Nov 14 02:06:31 .:debdrup:.	_xor: the description comes from the SYSCTL_PROC macro which sets a bunch of flags like if it's MPSAFE, whether it's read-only/can be changed before booting the kernel/can be changed at runtime, and a few other things.
Nov 14 02:07:43 .:debdrup:.	antranigv: I'm not a src committer, so it's very minimal what feedback I can give on the code - but since you'll hopefully be making manual page changes too, I can review those :3
Nov 14 02:08:28 .:antranigv:.	f*ck, I totally forgot about the manual
Nov 14 02:09:48 .:debdrup:.	Good thing you sought review then :3

Nov 14 02:31:56 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	(and since service(8) is in /usr/sbin, there's no reason why it can't use a /usr/bin command.
Nov 14 02:31:59 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	)
Nov 14 02:33:02 .:antranigv:.	What's the 2022 style of contributing to FreeBSD? still using arc?
Nov 14 02:33:24 .:rtprio:.	arc?
Nov 14 02:36:04 .:antranigv:.	yeah, arcanist or something
Nov 14 02:36:08 .:antranigv:.	for phabricator
Nov 14 02:36:23 .:antranigv:.	hey, can I use -j flag for multicore complication for ports?
Nov 14 02:36:41 .:rtprio:.	yes, you can use -j but not all ports will build sucessfully
Nov 14 02:37:28 .:antranigv:.	ugh, maybe I should just configure poudriere and be done with it
Nov 14 02:38:06 .:rtprio:.	how many ports are you building?

Nov 14 02:39:02 .:rtprio:.	pkg install -y arcanist
Nov 14 02:39:20 .:rtprio:.	i would think poudriere would be overkill for this application
Nov 14 02:39:26 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	antraniv, which arch?
Nov 14 02:39:31 .:antranigv:.	it's -CURRENT, so let's hope no ABI issues.
Nov 14 02:39:39 .:antranigv:.	V_PauAmma_V I'm on aarch64
Nov 14 02:39:40 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	s/v/gv/
Nov 14 02:39:51 .:rtprio:.	oh
Nov 14 02:41:05 .:antranigv:.	oh, we have a package! okay, things are better on aarch64 FreeBSD, yey
Nov 14 02:47:00 .:debdrup:.	Using poudriere for any number of packages is fine, because it makes things like cross-builds much easier.

Nov 15 03:16:49 .:kolla:.	mason: regarding ssh to iso boot, yes that is what I ended up with doing... like I wrote, not entirely an "out of the box" experience :)
Nov 15 03:17:36 .:mason:.	kolla: Maybe someday I'll get involved enough to offer up patches.
Nov 15 03:17:51 .:kolla:.	also... I got my zroot as I want eventually - I really cannot tell what I did different, but it _might_ have been a mislocated "canmount" vs. specified mountpoints
Nov 15 03:18:04 .:mason:.	That'd do it, sure.
Nov 15 03:20:52 .:kolla:.	so now I have 8x4TB, all disks partitioned the same, all bootable, all set with first 50GB zfs partitions in a mirror zpool, and remaining diskspace in a raidz3

Nov 15 17:10:39 .:xmj:.	dunno about specific process, what's always worked for me was local-unbound + dan pollock's /etc/hosts file converted to unbound syntax

Nov 16 00:11:55 .:ASHER:.	i will try
Nov 16 00:27:37 .:rwp:.	eniac, Kalten, I think the option you were looking for is ntpd -g and the /etc/rc.conf setting ntpd_sync_on_start="YES" which causes -g to be passed.
Nov 16 00:28:47 .:dh:.	rtprio: I did read fetch man pages beforehand, but didn't find them helpful in my endaveour. But it was stupid magical thinkting that it could work in the firstplace.
Nov 16 00:29:16 .:rtprio:.	dh: perhaps there's another way to do what you're trying
Nov 16 00:29:44 .:Kalten:.	rwp: Ah! Thank you!
Nov 16 00:31:31 .:dh:.	rtprio: Yeah, NAT - the device is in private network that needs to have an access to public network
Nov 16 00:32:02 .:rtprio:.	wonder if ssh dynamic port forwarding would work for that
Nov 16 00:36:35 .:rwp:.	Kalten, I had to work through that myself not long ago.  I'll note that ntpd -g (and ntpd_sync_on_start="YES") is now documented as preferred over using ntpdate.
Nov 16 00:39:48 .:rtprio:.	dh: can you ssh out from that private network?
Nov 16 00:40:52 .:rtprio:.	https://bsd.to/y8AJ
Nov 16 00:40:53 .:VimDiesel:.	Title: dpaste/y8AJ (Plain Text)
Nov 16 00:44:45 .:rwp:.	Kalten, eniac, Also I recommend to check the health of ntp config using "ntpq -p" to ntp query print the status. Offset and Jitter should be small'ish numbers, Reach should be mostly octal 1's bitmap. Poll starts at 64 seconds and lengthens as the clock stabilizes.
Nov 16 00:45:07 .:eniac:.	Tks man
Nov 16 00:49:05 .:dh:.	rtprio: I can ssh to another machine (with known IP address from said private network), that has access to public network
Nov 16 00:49:28 .:rtprio:.	then there you go
Nov 16 01:01:45 .:dh:.	rtprio: Oh man, it works! Thanks!
Nov 16 01:02:39 .:dh:.	But what gives .. SOCKS5 support came in 13.x?
Nov 16 01:03:02 .:rtprio:.	for fetch? i think it's been around for a long time
Nov 16 01:03:31 .:dh:.	On 12.2 manpage doesn't mention SOCKS5_PROXY environment variable
Nov 16 01:03:42 .:debdrup:.	consult the vcs history

Nov 16 13:33:56 .:Molnija:.	makes sense

Nov 16 13:46:31 .:Molnija:.	check the rc.d script (or other initializer if you use ote)

Nov 16 13:49:48 .:tuaris:.	oops
Nov 16 13:50:38 .:tuaris:.	nope, no luck with setting it in /etc/profile.  Still uses /tmp instead of the path I set
Nov 16 13:53:30 .:Kalten:.	I tend to set TMP to e.g. /usr/tmp/ system wide on systems with small /tmp/. (don't forget to `chmod 777 /usr/tmp ; chflags +t /usr/tmp` if I am not mistaken)
Nov 16 13:57:28 .:Kalten:.	tuaris: you could try to copy /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.sample to /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options and edit -Djava.io.tmpdir=
Nov 16 13:58:45 .:Molnija:.	tuaris: there's no elasticsearch.conf where this stuff is set?
Nov 16 13:59:59 .:Kalten:.	teh rc.d script does state `${elasticsearch_config=/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch}` and in that directory one could do, what I just stated
Nov 16 14:02:47 .:tuaris:.	Yes, and there is a /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options file that is being patched to use the ES_TMPDIR https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/textproc/elasticsearch6/files/patch-config_jvm.options

Nov 16 14:04:49 .:tuaris:.	I suppose I can just change it ther manually to fix my issue
Nov 16 14:04:59 .:Kalten:.	tuaris: let me think: there was a way to set parameters for the rc.d scripts inluding environments, iff I am not mistaken…
Nov 16 14:08:52 .:Kalten:.	you might try `elasticsearch_vars="ES_TMP=/usr/tmp/es_tmp` inside /etc/rc.conf????? I am not shure.
Nov 16 14:09:20 .:Molnija:.	You aren't the microphone company Shure, no.
Nov 16 14:12:39 .:Molnija:.	Kalten: It depends on if the RC script interprets that.
Nov 16 14:13:31 .:Kalten:.	Molnija: not my mother tongue. So: “sure”.
Nov 16 14:15:28 .:Kalten:.	tuaris: if you enter `ES_TMP=/usr/tmp/mydirforit` inside /etc/rc.conf—did you try this allready?
Nov 16 14:16:09 .:Kalten:.	(I don't know, whether a restart would be needed)
Nov 16 14:18:27 .:Kalten:.	(or maybe `export ES_TMP=/usr/tmp/mydirforit` inside /etc/rc.local)
Nov 16 14:27:36 .:tuaris:.	I tried /etc/rc.local, and (even after rebooting) it didn't pick it up.  Let me try /etc/rc.conf.  Though I thought setting env vars in that was frowned upon?
Nov 16 14:30:47 .:tuaris:.	Nope, didn't work with /etc/rc.conf either.
Nov 16 15:56:13 .:f451:.	zfs send is very bursty
Nov 16 15:56:29 .:f451:.	not a complaint, just an obs
Nov 16 15:56:45 .:f451:.	using mbuffer to buffer it
Nov 16 16:03:13 .:Kalten:.	tuaris: in /etc/rc.conf
Nov 16 16:03:14 .:Kalten:.	`export ES_TMP="/usr/tmp/mytempdir"` sets it for /usr/local/etc/rc.d/elasticsearch
Nov 16 16:08:28 .:dch:.	tuaris: you can usually do `${name}_env="...=..."` for all ports using rc.subr
Nov 16 16:08:58 .:dch:.	see https://man.freebsd.org/rc.subr _env
Nov 16 16:09:00 .:VimDiesel:.	Title: rc.subr
Nov 16 16:10:41 .:dch:.	tuaris: IMO that is the correct way to do it, that sets if specifically for just this port
Nov 16 16:11:03 .:dch:.	lol in fact I have precisely this in my /etc/conf.d/elasticsearch `elasticsearch_env="JAVA_HOME=/usr/local"`
Nov 16 16:11:57 .:Kalten:.	dch: nice
Nov 16 16:12:53 .:tuaris:.	 /etc/conf.d/ ? is that new
Nov 16 16:13:24 .:dch:.	no its old. I just use it to keep each application in a separate file. Makes ansible/puppet/chef life *much* simpler to template and manage.
Nov 16 16:13:46 .:dch:.	see load_rc_config in the same manpage :-)
Nov 16 16:13:54 .:tuaris:.	that is insteresting.
Nov 16 16:14:27 .:dch:.	yeah
Nov 16 16:14:39 .:dch:.	after finding this, all my automation scripts look roughly the same:
Nov 16 16:14:42 .:dch:.	- install some packages
Nov 16 16:14:58 .:dch:.	- drop a single /etc/rc.conf.d/$service template file
Nov 16 16:15:15 .:dch:.	- maybe a /usr/local/etc/$thing file too if needed
Nov 16 16:15:21 .:dch:.	- sprinkle some zfs datasets
Nov 16 16:15:25 .:dch:.	- start it
Nov 16 16:15:26 .:tuaris:.	oh, you mean /etc/rc.conf.d/
Nov 16 16:15:39 .:dch:.	oh tuaris my dyslexic bad, yes
Nov 16 16:17:05 .:tuaris:.	I see so you can basiclly append a "_env" to an rc.d startup script name to set variables
Nov 16 16:17:26 .:dch:.	yeah there are a lot of options like this, ${name}_$STUFF in there
Nov 16 16:17:47 .:dch:.	far too many for me to remember
Nov 16 16:21:45 .:tuaris:.	yep that did it.  It worked
Nov 16 16:24:31 .:tuaris:.	does that ${name}_env work with multiple entries or do all the variables need to be set in a single one?
Nov 16 16:24:51 .:tuaris:.	well, maybe I'll go read tha man page.  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction
Nov 16 16:35:45 .:Kalten:.	tuaris: likely `bla_env="tmp=/usr/tmp:startdir=/usr/local/bin"` i.e. “:” to list them, not likely “;”.
Nov 16 17:52:47 .:dch:.	IIRC it's `bla_env='A=B C=D' because its just inserted in front of `env`
Nov 16 17:54:02 .:dch:.	BTW you can *also* put things in their own file and use `bla_env_file`
Nov 16 17:56:27 .:dch:.	AFAICT from reading source `bla_env` just does eval of all of that
Nov 16 17:56:40 .:dch:.	so use spaces not colons

Nov 17 22:37:04 .:rtprio:.	Sircle: convince the maintainer to support it; or fork the project and maintain it yourself.
Nov 17 22:37:24 .:rtprio:.	Sircle: you have a ci pipeline that uses puppeteer?
Nov 17 22:38:29 .:Sircle:.	rtprio what would the maintainer/ me have to do to support puppeteer in freebsd? deal with some binaries or soemthing?
Nov 17 22:38:39 .:Sircle:.	rtprio no its a scrappign app
Nov 17 22:39:13 .:Sircle:.	and we have written code already. Just thinking to shift to freebsd for more stability and better use of system resources that as compared to linux
Nov 17 22:39:30 .:rtprio:.	Sircle: if you have to ask, you're probably not cut out for it. you would need to modify the code to work with freebsd ( assuming it can be done) and keep the code up to date and secure

Nov 17 22:40:22 .:Sircle:.	rtprio its already being used on a linux machine. I am jus ttesting bsd on a vm as guest
Nov 17 22:42:20 .:Sircle:.	rtprio any more suggestions?
Nov 17 22:42:56 .:rtprio:.	i'm just wondering what are you scraping with this software
Nov 17 22:43:49 .:rtprio:.	i ask because i think it's a component of https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS and it's one reason i had to spin up a linux vm for it
Nov 17 22:43:51 .:VimDiesel:.	Title: GitHub - garris/BackstopJS: Catch CSS curve balls.
Nov 17 22:46:51 .:rtprio:.	the other thing i guess you could do is hire someone to make the `chromium --headless` work in freebsd
Nov 17 22:47:35 .:Sircle:.	if I plug out drive of one system that had freebsd installed and plug in on another hardware (different specs like ram, cpu etc), will it work?
Nov 17 22:47:45 .:Sircle:.	rtprio I hired myself and just fixed it
Nov 17 22:48:14 .:rtprio:.	yes, you should be able to move the drive around; the network might need to be adjusted
Nov 17 22:48:25 .:Sircle:.	network?
Nov 17 22:48:34 .:Sircle:.	oh the dhcp kind of thing?
Nov 17 22:49:07 .:Sircle:.	so the drivers etc are inside freebsd. I don't need to reinstall or worry about crashing anything.?
Nov 17 22:49:10 .:rtprio:.	if the network card is different, the config will need to be changed- that's the `ifconfig_em0="DHCP"` line
Nov 17 22:49:18 .:rtprio:.	you don't need to reinstall
Nov 17 22:49:31 .:Sircle:.	rtprio are you a linux user too? how much performance difference of same resource utilization have you observed as compared to fbsd/
Nov 17 22:49:48 .:Sircle:.	ok on netword
Nov 17 22:49:55 .:Sircle:.	ok on network
Nov 17 22:50:35 .:rtprio:.	i only run linux for when i need docker or ..headless chromium
Nov 17 22:50:54 .:rtprio:.	i much prefer the resource utilization of freebsd
Nov 17 22:51:14 .:Sircle:.	oh so you also use puppeteer?
Nov 17 22:51:42 .:Sircle:.	rtprio how do you compaire efficiency of linux and freebsd in terms of resource utilization percentage efficiency?
Nov 17 22:51:52 .:rtprio:.	i just said i use backstopjs, which uses puppeteer as a component
Nov 17 22:52:21 .:rtprio:.	well, systemd strikes me as extremely inefficient, so that's a pretty big strike for linux
Nov 17 22:56:14 .:Sircle:.	rtprio ok anything else? UI difference, daemons differences, browsers, video, nginx, web servers?
Nov 17 22:56:21 .:Sircle:.	heavy load?
Nov 17 22:56:23 .:Sircle:.	xorg?
Nov 17 22:56:34 .:Sircle:.	I had a lot of bad times with linux xorg though
Nov 17 22:58:10 .:rtprio:.	Sircle: too subjctive and very much depends on the workload
Nov 17 22:59:00 .:rtprio:.	furthermore few people have the time to set up two identical systems, one linux and one freebsd to see how they diffrent.
Nov 17 23:00:12 .:rtprio:.	so it becomes "use the right tool for the task"
Nov 17 23:00:47 .:Sircle:.	ok
Nov 17 23:02:00 .:V_PauAmma_V:.	Or sometimes "use the tool that fits your hand" or "use the tool that suits your taste".
Nov 17 23:07:04 .:Sircle:.	ya :)
Nov 17 23:07:32 .:Sircle:.	I just wanted stability and efficiency. Freebsd has it but the items it can run is limitiing me.

Dec 07 05:14:46 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Time for a bit of freebsd love. I always liked the concept of the bsd family, but never thought it could be a full desktop. Boy, how wrong I was. I installed sway wm, and it really felt like a complete experience. I have decided to keep freebsd on my laptop ;)

Dec 07 23:43:30 .:meena:.	_xor: yes, you should
Dec 07 23:43:35 .:_xor:.	Latest version has builtin key-values+secrets management (optional if you have Vault, but an out-of-box feature that can be used quickly).
Dec 07 23:44:22 .:_xor:.	I have a ton of ports that I should submit, just haven't gotten around to it yet due to time. FUZxxl was going to help me go through them and clean them up, but time is currently scarce.
Dec 07 23:44:51 .:_xor:.	At last count I think I had something like 80 ports or so left that I was going to submit :/
Dec 08 00:10:58 .:meena:.	_xor: wouldn't it be cool if submitting ports was slightly less painful than bugzilla or phabricator?
Dec 08 00:13:13 .:_xor:.	Probably, but I suspect it's more of a human/process problem then a infrastructure/tooling problem.
Dec 08 00:51:48 .:msiism:.	I've configured root's PS1 to be just "\h:\w\\$ ". Is there any compelling reason to actually make it show "root@"?

Dec 08 18:12:23 .:yo9fah:.	how dangerous is it if I installed FreeBSD 14.0-current!? Is something exploding!? :D
Dec 08 18:13:10 .:daemon:.	anythign with -current is basically 'be prepared for anything'
Dec 08 18:13:29 .:daemon:.	unless you have a specific reason to use it, then it is suggested not to
Dec 08 18:14:58 .:yo9fah:.	thanks! I'm actually having fun. :P
Dec 08 18:15:39 .:yo9fah:.	It is installed alone on a single hdd
Dec 08 18:16:40 .:Grabunhold_:.	i think "having fun" is a very good reason, i wouldn't trust it with any production data but other than that... why not
Dec 08 18:18:50 .:yo9fah:.	I reinstalled 3.1 release and it works with drm-kmod. I'm thinking of reinstalling. but if nothing explodes,... why not...! :D
Dec 08 18:21:28 .:yo9fah:.	I wanted an installation with lxqt-1.2.6, I tried to compile from the port and at the end it gives me an error...
Dec 08 18:56:51 .:melty:.	why does freebsd have to many 666 in the configs???? this is a demonic os!!!!
Dec 08 19:01:45 .:Ellenor:.	melty, where's that come from?
Dec 08 19:02:01 .:Ellenor:.	is this just some superstition?
Dec 08 19:03:10 .:meena:.	melty: files of that mode, or that number in config files?
Dec 08 19:03:35 .:Ellenor:.	how old are you
Dec 08 19:08:39 .:meena:.	38, give or take…
