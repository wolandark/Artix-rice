Nov 15 16:38:17 .:fsbot:.	their higher incidence of change, don’t make sense to put into Emacs’s ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Nov 15 16:38:44 .:jlf:.	try C-h v site-run-file
Nov 15 16:40:33 .:parsnip:.	does M-x find-library RET site-start RET find it?
Nov 15 16:41:06 .:parsnip:.	C-h v doesn't seem to show me the location of site-start.el
Nov 15 16:41:56 .:parsnip:.	for me it's /nix/store/a80ilgf691pxrfzb6sjsq5n18nyb2b97-emacs-28.2/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el
Nov 15 16:42:50 .:Necktwi:.	can't find library: site-start
Nov 15 16:42:56 .:Necktwi:.	for me
Nov 15 16:43:18 .:jlf:.	hence my not suggesting that :)
Nov 15 16:43:56 .:Necktwi:.	but site-run-file to didn't help locating it on windows
Nov 15 16:44:04 .:Necktwi:.	too*
Nov 15 16:48:06 .:edgar-rft:.	site-run-file contains only the file-name but not the diretory path :-(
Nov 15 16:56:21 .:edgar-rft:.	Necktwi: the load-path variable holds a list of all directories where Emacs searches for Elisp files, it should also contain the directory for site-wide files, but the list is rather long.
Nov 15 16:57:33 .:mooseball:.	can "\b" in a regexp search be used to handle #hashtags or @mentions? currently it would match the 'h' and 'm' of those
Nov 15 17:01:36 .:quiliro:.	hello
Nov 15 17:01:54 .:quiliro:.	anyone know how to send a bug report to exwm with email?
Nov 15 17:02:12 .:edrx:.	hi quiliro!
Nov 15 17:05:24 .:Necktwi:.	edgar-rft, thanks i've put it in emacs\emacs-28.1\share\emacs\28.1\site-lisp and it worked
Nov 15 17:05:39 .:pkal:.	quiliro: The package appears to be developed on GitHub... Perhaps you can send the maintainer a message?
Nov 15 17:11:16 .:quiliro:.	I don't have a github account
Nov 15 17:14:17 .:olivermead:.	given that, if you're having some moral objections against github I understand, you could email the maintainer, making clear in the subject what it's about. But I wouldn't necessarily expect a response or a response other than "file an issue on github"
Nov 15 17:15:29 .:grym:.	https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#contributing
Nov 15 17:15:40 .:grym:.	join github or dox yourself to the fsf
Nov 15 17:16:23 .:parsnip:.	for a bug report?
Nov 15 17:18:43 .:grym:.	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Nov 15 17:19:02 .:olivermead:.	does anyone use and/or recognise `lm-report-bug' ?
Nov 15 17:19:02 .:grym:.	i mean, if you're dual-publishing on savannah and github, surely you know what email is and that your users are going to use it to find you
Nov 15 17:20:37 .:parsnip:.	grym: *yes
Nov 15 17:22:01 .:parsnip:.	i guess i don't understand the motivation for users to muck around with a site-start.el
Nov 15 17:23:59 .:pjb:.	parsnip: indeed, it's worth only when you have a multi-user computer. Nowadays, most computers are single-user, or almost single-user.
Nov 15 17:26:25 .:edrx:.	quiliro: I think that it would be easier to get help on how to do things with the level of purity that you want if you keep a blog about what you've been able to do so far, and how you did it

Nov 15 23:21:08 .:stef204:.	I'll delete the exec-path-from-shell package and see if it helps
Nov 15 23:26:47 .:stef204:.	no joy
Nov 15 23:26:56 .:stef204:.	still broken
Nov 15 23:27:53 .:stef204:.	I don't know if somehow I inroduced some small error like deleting a bracket unintentionally, spelling error in init file, etc. no idea...
Nov 15 23:28:48 .:lechner:.	Hi, I opened the small clone 'mg' in a vterm. Is there any way to close mg?
Nov 15 23:29:40 .:oats:.	lechner, mg is not emacs, but have you tried Ctrl-x Ctrl-c in succession?
Nov 15 23:29:50 .:oats:.	I've heard it has similar default keybindings
Nov 15 23:30:14 .:hodapp:.	the problem is that sending C-x C-c will try to quit the outer Emacs, not mg inside vterm
Nov 15 23:30:33 .:hodapp:.	I just successfully tried:  M-x vterm-send-C-x, M-x vterm-send-C-c
Nov 15 23:30:36 .:oats:.	oh, I misread vterm as xterm
Nov 15 23:30:52 .:hodapp:.	or, C-c C-c instead of the latter M-x
Nov 15 23:35:25 .:lechner:.	hodapp / yay! thanks so much
Nov 15 23:35:34 .:hodapp:.	sure
Nov 15 23:35:52 .:hodapp:.	I was stuck here once after doing 'git commit' on a remote host inside vterm...
Nov 15 23:40:31 .:mekeor[m]:.	whats the difference between zile and mg?
Nov 15 23:42:00 .:lechner:.	mekeor[m] / two letters less to type, and maybe it's faster. for a while, it also seemed to have greater hopes for UTF-8 support.
Nov 15 23:42:27 .:Catie:.	Does Zile have an extension language?
Nov 15 23:42:36 .:EdwardIII:.	presumably lua
Nov 15 23:43:00 .:Catie:.	I'm pretty sure mg is completely un-extensible
Nov 15 23:44:17 .:hodapp:.	yeah, I believe it is too
Nov 15 23:44:23 .:hodapp:.	beyond very basic configuration file (maybe)
Nov 15 23:44:40 .:mekeor[m]:.	they are both not gnu projects, right?
Nov 15 23:44:51 .:Catie:.	mg is OpenBSD, if I remember correctly
Nov 15 23:45:27 .:Catie:.	Looks that way, though it didn't originate in the OpenBSD project
Nov 15 23:52:26 .:twb:.	Let's respond to parliamentary question time with "You fool!  This isn't even my FINAL FORM!"
Nov 15 23:53:14 .:hodapp:.	Let's respod to parliamentary question time by writing an 800-page tome about how parliamentary democracy is the scourge of all of mankind and all the newspapers suck because they're writing mean things and everyone is a bunch of dumb Marxists
Nov 15 23:53:59 .:twb:.	>looks at newspaper< "Honey, you won't believe this.  Newspapers are still A Thing!"
Nov 15 23:59:24 .:quiliro:.	Are social networks the only way to cmmunicate nowadays?
Nov 15 23:59:42 .:quiliro:.	are we doomed by the www?
Nov 15 23:59:58 .:quiliro:.	internet is good....but why only use www
Nov 16 00:00:09 .:oats:.	quiliro, I hear SMS still technically exists
Nov 16 00:00:18 .:twb:.	quiliro: because of how internet was initially monetized
Nov 16 00:00:21 .:quiliro:.	I still use it! :-)
Nov 16 00:00:31 .:twb:.	quiliro: rich protocols can't be used by advertisers
Nov 16 00:00:50 .:twb:.	and since services are funded by advertising instead of residuals, that's the only option
Nov 16 00:01:28 .:Catie:.	I might be wrong, but isn't IRC still around somewhere?
Nov 16 00:01:31 .:quiliro:.	yes they can be monetized....information can be monetized and servers can gather information
Nov 16 00:02:05 .:quiliro:.	not as much though
Nov 16 00:02:48 .:hodapp:.	only way to communicate? plenty of people use things like Signal and Whatsapp and whatever that IM system is in China that has 2,000,000,000 users
Nov 16 00:03:09 .:hodapp:.	and email still. and things like Slack and Discord that are borderline social networks if at all
Nov 16 00:03:32 .:twb:.	hodapp: wechat
Nov 16 00:03:39 .:oats:.	I will admit I'm sad I sometimes miss out on big extended family news because I'm not on FB
Nov 16 00:03:47 .:quiliro:.	I consider whatsapp and friends social networks...you don't?
Nov 16 00:03:51 .:oats:.	I rely on my parents relaying it to me over signal :<
Nov 16 00:04:05 .:twb:.	you have an extended family you LIKE?
Nov 16 00:04:14 .:oats:.	twb, most of them, fortunately
Nov 16 00:04:35 .:Catie:.	Hell yeah, that's a victory
Nov 16 00:04:38 .:quiliro:.	I dislike all my family. except the ones I live with
Nov 16 00:04:58 .:quiliro:.	so i don't even need signal
Nov 16 00:05:26 .:quiliro:.	LOL
Nov 16 00:06:38 .:quiliro:.	Family relationships are those which were not chosen by you.
Nov 16 00:06:52 .:quiliro:.	at least blood family
Nov 16 00:07:31 .:Catie:.	Maybe initially, but you do get to choose whether or not to keep associating with them
Nov 16 00:07:39 .:quiliro:.	you do
Nov 16 00:07:52 .:quiliro:.	but there is social presureç
Nov 16 00:08:01 .:quiliro:.	to keep those relationships
Nov 16 00:08:04 .:Catie:.	Agreed, I'm less of a fan of that
Nov 16 00:09:03 .:oats:.	hey, you do what you gotta do
Nov 16 00:09:08 .:quiliro:.	if you could choose other people share your time with, would you select other relationships?
Nov 16 00:09:46 .:quiliro:.	you feel like you have to do it....but you do not really have to...it is your own life, not theirs
Nov 16 00:10:02 .:quiliro:.	feeling obliged does not mean being forced
Nov 16 00:10:23 .:quiliro:.	we always have hopes that the relationships will be good
Nov 16 00:10:35 .:quiliro:.	but when they are not, we keep trying

Nov 16 00:24:31 .:aidalgol:.	Catie: Just OOC, you play games much?
Nov 16 00:26:15 .:Catie:.	aidalgol: Oh, sometimes. Love me the adventure hack-and-slashers, but I wouldn't really say I'm a gamer per se
Nov 16 00:26:35 .:aidalgol:.	Catie: Wise choice.  "Gamer" has not the nicest connotations.
Nov 16 00:26:44 .:aidalgol:.	Have you tried NieR:Automata?
Nov 16 00:27:01 .:Catie:.	I haven't, though I've seen a bit about it! Would you recommend it?
Nov 16 00:27:59 .:aidalgol:.	Yes, highly!  It's like a genre deconstruction.
Nov 16 00:28:29 .:Catie:.	Twenty-six different endings??
Nov 16 00:28:29 .:fsbot:.	No
Nov 16 00:28:36 .:aidalgol:.	Just note that you *have* to play more than once to get the fully story.  (That's not as repetitive as it sounds, but saying any more would be spoilery.)
Nov 16 00:28:47 .:aidalgol:.	Catie: It counts a lot of silly game-over endings in that.
Nov 16 00:28:55 .:bremner:.	aidalgol: what about Gamier and Gamiest?
Nov 16 00:28:58 .:aidalgol:.	Like one is accepting a merchant's request to eat a fish.
Nov 16 00:29:03 .:bremner:.	personally I enjoy a goat curry
Nov 16 00:29:13 .:Catie:.	aidalgol: Yeah, but like. Well like I gotta find them all
Nov 16 00:29:14 .:aidalgol:.	bremner: I'll curry you in a minute
Nov 16 00:29:24 .:bremner:.	yay, attention, that which I crave!
Nov 16 00:29:41 .:bremner:.	unless you're doing something weird with partial evaluation
Nov 16 00:31:00 .:aidalgol:.	Catie: If you don't play a lot of games, then you may very well enjoy going for 100%.  Nowadays, I have precious little time for gaming, so I don't push myself to play games that I bought and only sort of enjoy, or going for 100% on pretty much any game now.
Nov 16 00:31:14 .:aidalgol:.	There are still some rare exceptions.
Nov 16 00:31:44 .:Catie:.	aidalgol: I've only 100%-ed a couple of games in my life, but I've got that borderline-obsessive completionist streak to me

Nov 16 11:43:22 .:thuna`:.	Ok, do I just not have the correct ctags?
Nov 16 11:43:25 .:olivermead:.	xaltsc: ah, doesn't seem there's a way currently without overriding some of org-num-mode's functions
Nov 16 11:43:48 .:olivermead:.	thuna`: I'm using Universal Ctags 5.9.0, "Universal Ctags is derived from Exuberant Ctags"
Nov 16 11:43:53 .:xaltsc:.	olivermead: thanks anyway :)
Nov 16 11:44:04 .:olivermead:.	thuna`: what's your ctags --version?
Nov 16 11:44:51 .:thuna`:.	olivermead: This, for some reason. "ctags (GNU Emacs 29.0.50) Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  This program is distributed under the terms in ETAGS.README"
Nov 16 11:45:16 .:thuna`:.	That's the entire output, and I'm not seeing anything resembling a version
Nov 16 11:45:27 .:olivermead:.	thuna`: if it's emacs's ctags it'll do etags by default, so no need for -e ;)
Nov 16 11:47:03 .:thuna`:.	Well, I got rid of the `e', so it's not "ctags -R -f \"%s\" %s \"%s\"", but now I'm getting the error "ctags: unrecognized option ’--exclude=^\\.idea$’"
Nov 16 11:47:31 .:thuna`:.	not -> now
Nov 16 11:48:14 .:olivermead:.	yes it seems projectile is assuming exuberant ctags, might be best to use that or rewrite the tags command
Nov 16 11:51:32 .:olivermead:.	ctags.emacs doesn't seem to have an option for excluding files
Nov 16 11:59:27 .:bpalmer:.	with version control,excluding files is always just an rm away
Nov 16 11:59:59 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: follow me for other terrible tips.
Nov 16 12:00:00 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: maybe the Broadway spiderman should consult the Hollywood spiderman for a few safety tips
Nov 16 12:00:24 .:bpalmer:.	a New Yorker, ask a Californian for advice? Nobody would believe it.
Nov 16 12:04:44 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: ok, I'm thinking of a recipe involving lentils and chiles
Nov 16 12:04:45 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: has chiles rellenos regularlyish
Nov 16 12:08:44 .:olivermead:.	EXWM is coming off very un-emacs-ey to me, like you can't modify/add to/remove from its global keybindings while it's running
Nov 16 12:10:36 .:olivermead:.	It also kills the emacs server when you leave if you started X with emacsclient -c
Nov 16 12:14:28 .:roadie:.	olivermead[m]: the 'error' is that it asks: 'select coding system default raw text' - I would like it to just choose raw text. Not sure if that is lynx asking ...
Nov 16 12:25:24 .:taeaad:.	Is there much of a difference between autopep8 and blacken?
Nov 16 12:34:29 .:olivermead:.	taeaad: black is pep8 compliant and deliberately limits configuration, autopep8 does not fix all issues reported by pycodestyle by default, that involves command flags or configuration
Nov 16 12:35:37 .:olivermead:.	personally I prefer black's approach
Nov 16 12:37:02 .:taeaad:.	olivermead: Thanks!
Nov 16 12:40:21 .:olivermead:.	,emacs-related-p python formatters
Nov 16 12:40:23 .:fsbot:.	It may not be that obvious for the layman, but python formatters is indeed emacs-related, olivermead.

Nov 16 14:13:15 .:dutchie:.	at least if you consider nil to be a list

Nov 16 14:15:05 .:pwr:.	a dotted list is a cons

Nov 16 17:08:28 .:danisanti:.	it seems that TAB does it
Nov 16 17:11:27 .:jbe:.	for buffer you can probably do C-x h C-M-\ (mark-whole-buffer, indent-region)
Nov 16 17:12:38 .:jrootabega:.	olivermead: did you lose any work?
Nov 16 17:18:28 .:jlf:.	danisanti: in general, mark the region you want to indent (e.g. mark-defun via C-M-h) and then indent-region via C-M-\
Nov 16 17:22:32 .:olivermead:.	jrootabega: no, only my dignity and a few hours of irc history
Nov 16 17:23:53 .:cvandusen:.	rudybot: those who lose irc history are doomed to repeat it
Nov 16 17:23:54 .:rudybot:.	cvandusen: those who forget ,,dv file-name-history are doomed to repeat it
Nov 16 17:24:41 .:jrootabega:.	Good to hear. I've thought about rescue tools to evacuate critical stuff from a doomed emacs session. Saving stuff, fixing unreadable fonts, forcing basic keybinds only, etc.
Nov 16 17:25:53 .:olivermead:.	jrootabega: a fallback to behave as -Q, unloading everything would be cool
Nov 16 17:29:51 .:jrootabega:.	Yeah, if you could accomplish that, you could load in other stuff you need (if any) to save your work gracefully. Although I think getting an arbitrary session back to -Q would be very difficult.

Nov 16 17:34:26 .:fsbot:.	Olá binarydigitz01!
Nov 16 17:37:54 .:binarydigitz01:.	I'm thinking of setting up emacs for mail
Nov 16 17:38:06 .:binarydigitz01:.	but there's a lot of them.
Nov 16 17:38:13 .:binarydigitz01:.	* a lot of options
Nov 16 17:38:22 .:binarydigitz01:.	anyone wanna share their opinion on this?
Nov 16 17:38:30 .:danisanti:.	binarydigitz01: I use Gnus
Nov 16 17:38:48 .:danisanti:.	there is the IRC channel #gnus
Nov 16 17:39:04 .:grym:.	gnus, notmuch-emacs, and mu4e seem to be the big boys
Nov 16 17:39:12 .:grym:.	i use none of them, so i can't help much
Nov 16 17:39:27 .:binarydigitz01:.	is there a guide on the web which i can read?
Nov 16 17:39:34 .:binarydigitz01:.	don't know what to use?
Nov 16 17:42:18 .:danisanti:.	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusTutorial
Nov 16 17:43:45 .:binarydigitz01:.	thanks!
Nov 16 17:46:56 .:danisanti:.	binarydigitz01: no problem. I also found useful this -> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail
Nov 16 17:47:21 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: Depending on what you want, Gnus can be the simplest to set up
Nov 16 17:47:28 .:pkal:.	But perhaps not the most intutitive to use.
Nov 16 17:47:47 .:pkal:.	Perhaps it is easier if you actually finish reading the entire manual
Nov 16 17:52:03 .:gnucode:.	is there a way to make company mode not complete fuzzily.  so "now" DOES not complete to "known"?
Nov 16 17:53:11 .:gnucode:.	it is really hard to talk to people in irc, when it randomly completes to irc nicknames, that I am not trying to complete to.  And it might be nice if I it would NOT complete when i type 2 characters, but only 3 characters.
Nov 16 17:54:59 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: i see thanks
Nov 16 17:55:57 .:binarydigitz01:.	I don't use company but I am almost certain both of those things are possible
Nov 16 17:56:14 .:binarydigitz01:.	gnucode:
Nov 16 17:56:58 .:gnucode:.	binarydigitz01: thanks.
Nov 16 17:57:13 .:binarydigitz01:.	I believe you can set completion styles in completion-category-defaults
Nov 16 17:59:40 .:pkal:.	Company doesn't map directly onto capf-completion, so there might be some other things going on as well.  Have you been able to reproduce the same behaviour using emacs -q, binarydigitz01?
Nov 16 18:01:37 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: i was not the one who asked the q lol
Nov 16 18:01:43 .:binarydigitz01:.	gnucode:
Nov 16 18:02:12 .:heinz9:.	can someone help me with setting a theme for hugo?
Nov 16 18:06:37 .:rpav:.	it is possible someone, somewhere is able
Nov 16 18:06:58 .:gnucode:.	pkal: I have not tried via emacs -q
Nov 16 18:07:34 .:hodapp:.	heinz9: what problems are you running into?
Nov 16 18:11:02 .:heinz9:.	I am not able to set the theme, either hugo cannot start with an error or no other theme is displayed
Nov 16 18:11:09 .:heinz9:.	I clone into the theme dir a theme
Nov 16 18:11:17 .:binarydigitz01:.	gnucode: set company-minimum-prefix-length to 3
Nov 16 18:11:56 .:heinz9:.	and what I tried was just setting path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme"
Nov 16 18:12:03 .:heinz9:.	or theme = "hugo-theme-w3css-basic"
Nov 16 18:12:30 .:heinz9:.	and I also tried other themes
Nov 16 18:12:44 .:heinz9:.	and a video and other documentation also did not helped
Nov 16 18:12:50 .:parsnip:.	/,memory-guards is RELEASE THEM!!
Nov 16 18:13:39 .:heinz9:.	am I too stupid or is the documentation just too bad?
Nov 16 18:16:07 .:hodapp:.	heinz9: so you have the theme in a subdirectory in 'themes', and your config.toml has that subdirectory's name in 'theme'?
Nov 16 18:16:27 .:heinz9:.	yes
Nov 16 18:16:34 .:heinz9:.	theme = "hugo-theme-w3css-basic"
Nov 16 18:17:07 .:heinz9:.	themes/hugo-theme-w3css-basic/
Nov 16 18:17:54 .:hodapp:.	this is all I'm doing and I've had it work fine with various themes
Nov 16 18:18:08 .:gnucode:.	binarydigitz01: yup.  I found that one!  thanks!
Nov 16 18:24:59 .:heinz9:.	I needed to create the themes folder
Nov 16 18:25:25 .:heinz9:.	and it was set before: path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme"
Nov 16 18:25:29 .:heinz9:.	is this wrong?
Nov 16 18:25:41 .:heinz9:.	in [[module.imports]]
Nov 16 18:27:14 .:heinz9:.	themesDir                  = "themes"
Nov 16 18:29:29 .:heinz9:.	adding this does not help
Nov 16 18:55:37 .:thblt:.	do you *need* to use the module approach?
Nov 16 19:07:58 .:heinz9:.	so you start your ox hugo site with that ? https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/tests-site/
Nov 16 19:10:05 .:Bayes:.	I keep my an .org file with TODOs instead of using github issues, fight me
Nov 16 19:10:41 .:olivermead:.	Bayes: so reporting bugs is a PR?
Nov 16 19:10:51 .:hodapp:.	Bayes: I do this sometimes too
Nov 16 19:10:59 .:grym:.	one day i will grok org-jira
Nov 16 19:11:04 .:grym:.	.. ha ha no i won't
Nov 16 19:11:27 .:Bayes:.	olivermead, more like, reporting bugs is like adding a headline in my local org file
Nov 16 19:11:30 .:olivermead:.	grym: that's a lot of properties
Nov 16 19:11:36 .:tyson2:.	grym: yes it doesn't sound like an agreeable prospect
Nov 16 19:11:38 .:hodapp:.	at one point my bug tracking was just comments that included: "BUG", who reported, date, severity, priority, and description
Nov 16 19:11:42 .:olivermead:.	Bayes: o it's single user
Nov 16 19:11:48 .:Bayes:.	yep
Nov 16 19:11:51 .:hodapp:.	made it very easy to just grep for bugs
Nov 16 19:11:58 .:hodapp:.	and everything stayed tracked in version control
Nov 16 19:12:06 .:olivermead:.	beautiful
Nov 16 19:12:17 .:hodapp:.	there are some dedicated systems that do the same thing
Nov 16 19:12:44 .:olivermead:.	just an org-capture template
Nov 16 19:12:50 .:Bayes:.	there's an external collaborator that wants to pop in from time to time, but since their participation is sporadic they have no idea how the code works or what it does anyway
Nov 16 19:13:00 .:grym:.	Bayes: ah, a nuisance

Nov 16 19:13:14 .:olivermead:.	'

Nov 16 19:25:59 .:olivermead:.	bpalmer: where rat
Nov 16 19:26:30 .:bpalmer:.	we can't all expect a rat to come along and solve every problem.
Nov 16 19:27:00 .:roadie:.	Great minds run in great circles
Nov 16 19:28:32 .:binarydigitz01:.	I'm reading the elisp manual
Nov 16 19:28:43 .:binarydigitz01:.	about overlays
Nov 16 19:28:46 .:jbe:.	a rat maze and a kitchen both have cheese in them
Nov 16 19:29:02 .:binarydigitz01:.	and it says overlays are very heavy. Anyone any idea about how many overlays can i have?
Nov 16 19:29:25 .:parsnip:.	oh, prepatory school
Nov 16 19:29:31 .:bpalmer:.	binarydigitz01: you can have as many as you want, but they'll slow down emacs and use a lot of memory, potentially
Nov 16 19:29:54 .:bpalmer:.	on the other hand, you've got a *long* ways to go until you catch up to electron apps, so ...
Nov 16 19:29:59 .:parsnip:.	what dish is prepatory school preparing them _for_?
Nov 16 19:30:08 .:binarydigitz01:.	ah that's what i thought
Nov 16 19:30:13 .:binarydigitz01:.	not as heavy as they tell
Nov 16 19:31:11 .:bpalmer:.	binarydigitz01: If I recall, there are some suboptimal algorithms in use for overlays (perhaps O(n) traversal in a buffer?), so you do want to benchmark/test before you start designing a mode that relies upon heavy use of them
Nov 16 19:32:03 .:binarydigitz01:.	i see, also the manual says that in terms of visual effects, text properties and overlays are the same
Nov 16 19:32:13 .:binarydigitz01:.	so why would someone use overlay?
Nov 16 19:32:55 .:bpalmer:.	text properties move with the text (e.g., when you kill text, or take buffer-substring, or...)
Nov 16 19:33:10 .:bpalmer:.	overlays are associated with positions in a buffer, so aren't copied/moved.
Nov 16 19:34:14 .:binarydigitz01:.	oh
Nov 16 19:34:22 .:binarydigitz01:.	so overlays can be used for making buttons and stuff
Nov 16 19:34:29 .:binarydigitz01:.	like interactive modes?
Nov 16 19:35:22 .:binarydigitz01:.	neat
Nov 16 19:39:01 .:bpalmer:.	yes
Nov 16 20:35:19 .:binarydigitz01:.	Can someone ping me? testing notifications on erc
Nov 16 20:35:24 .:grym:.	binarydigitz01: no!
Nov 16 20:35:28 .:acdw:.	binarydigitz01: never!
Nov 16 20:35:33 .:grym:.	binarydigitz01: ,,ping,,

Nov 16 20:35:51 .:binarydigitz01:.	works nicely!
Nov 16 20:36:08 .:acdw:.	ope looks like org is "updating" again
Nov 16 20:37:06 .:grym:.	straight pins when
Nov 16 20:38:23 .:acdw:.	psh, straight's too complicated; i just wrote my own (bad) package manager
Nov 16 20:39:01 .:pkal:.	grym: what are "straight pins"?
Nov 16 20:39:17 .:acdw:.	straight.el pinning package versions i presume
Nov 16 20:39:19 .:grym:.	yes
Nov 16 20:40:21 .:binarydigitz01:.	acdw: plus, i believe the author of straight wrote another package manager
Nov 16 20:41:09 .:acdw:.	i think it was a maintainer, but yeah, elpaca is apparently getting good
Nov 16 20:41:22 .:binarydigitz01:.	yeah that
Nov 16 20:41:31 .:acdw:.	but i like mine, it's stupid enough that i can understand it :P{
Nov 16 20:41:38 .:binarydigitz01:.	lmao
Nov 16 20:42:16 .:binarydigitz01:.	I'm new to emacs, so take this with a grain of salt, but I believe that rather than making new package managers, we should just suggest addions to the emacs maintainers
Nov 16 20:42:53 .:binarydigitz01:.	I feel like writing to the mailing list about atleast having a recipe kind of system
Nov 16 20:43:05 .:binarydigitz01:.	so that we can download extensions from github
Nov 16 20:43:10 .:binarydigitz01:.	if they're not at melpa yet
Nov 16 20:43:16 .:pjb:.	Specifications are always good to propose.
Nov 16 20:43:34 .:pjb:.	The question is whether they'll be accepted and implemented.
Nov 16 20:44:07 .:pjb:.	But the job of product managers can (and should) be done for free software.
Nov 16 20:44:31 .:binarydigitz01:.	I honestly never talked to the maintainers, so i dont know what it's like
Nov 16 20:44:39 .:binarydigitz01:.	proposing ideas
Nov 16 20:44:43 .:acdw:.	binarydigitz01: package-vc is a thing
Nov 16 20:44:55 .:bremner:.	so is ,,install,,
Nov 16 20:44:56 .:fsbot:.	install: [0/5] To install a <file>.el, save it to e.g. ~/elisp
Nov 16 20:44:56 .:fsbot:.	[1] add to the beginning of ~/.emacs: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")
Nov 16 20:44:56 .:fsbot:.	[2] now FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FILE, typically adding (require '<file>) to the end of ~/.emacs
Nov 16 20:44:56 .:fsbot:.	[3] see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Nov 16 20:44:58 .:acdw:.	which i am watching
Nov 16 20:45:25 .:binarydigitz01:.	fsbot: I know about that, but that's manual
Nov 16 20:45:25 .:fsbot:.	am awesome
Nov 16 20:45:25 .:acdw:.	yeah that's really all it takes. my dumb "package manager" just downloads and adds a directory to load-path basically
Nov 16 20:45:42 .:acdw:.	i just wanted to automate that little piece
Nov 16 20:45:46 .:binarydigitz01:.	acdw: that's the point of the package manager
Nov 16 20:45:47 .:binarydigitz01:.	lol
Nov 16 20:45:56 .:acdw:.	well yeah so that's what i did
Nov 16 20:46:16 .:bremner:.	well, "real" package managers handle dependency resolution
Nov 16 20:46:21 .:binarydigitz01:.	as i was saying, fsbot, this is manual. You shouldn't have to do this. A package manager should handle this for you
Nov 16 20:46:31 .:bremner:.	binarydigitz01: fsbot is a bot
Nov 16 20:47:05 .:binarydigitz01:.	oh
Nov 16 20:47:06 .:binarydigitz01:.	lols
Nov 16 20:47:16 .:bremner:.	speaking of automation...
Nov 16 20:47:19 .:binarydigitz01:.	irc noob
Nov 16 20:47:20 .:binarydigitz01:.	moment
Nov 16 20:48:05 .:acdw:.	bremner: nah it don't do that lol. i manually look at the package-requires: cookie
Nov 16 20:48:30 .:acdw:.	which .. is good enough for me
Nov 16 20:48:32 .:bremner:.	your package manager probably doesn't even eat haggis
Nov 16 20:48:41 .:cvandusen:.	,cookie
Nov 16 20:48:41 .:fsbot:.	You worry too much about your job.  Stop it.  You are not paid enough to worry.
Nov 16 20:48:43 .:acdw:.	i can fix that
Nov 16 20:48:49 .:acdw:.	M-x yoke-eat-haggis RET
Nov 16 20:48:51 .:Catie:.	So true fsbot
Nov 16 20:49:01 .:acdw:.	(i called it yoke)
Nov 16 20:49:03 .:binarydigitz01:.	,cookie
Nov 16 20:49:03 .:fsbot:.	Your object is to save the world, while still leading a pleasant life.
Nov 16 20:49:15 .:acdw:.	oh it's a fortune cookie
Nov 16 20:49:17 .:binarydigitz01:.	wow, fsbot really does speak the truth
Nov 16 20:49:20 .:acdw:.	,botsnack
Nov 16 20:49:21 .:binarydigitz01:.	amazing
Nov 16 20:49:21 »»	fsbot dances happily
Nov 16 20:49:33 .:acdw:.	fsbot deserves a snack after dispensing such wisdom
Nov 16 20:49:41 .:Catie:.	A cookie, perhaps
Nov 16 20:49:42 .:binarydigitz01:.	yup
Nov 16 20:49:53 .:binarydigitz01:.	🍪
Nov 16 20:49:55 .:binarydigitz01:.	here fsbot
Nov 16 20:50:42 .:binarydigitz01:.	Can someone explain mailing lists to me
Nov 16 20:50:57 .:binarydigitz01:.	cause I don't know how to use them
Nov 16 20:51:03 .:binarydigitz01:.	other than subscribing to it
Nov 16 20:51:07 .:binarydigitz01:.	is there a guide or something?
Nov 16 20:51:10 .:acdw:.	that's how u use em
Nov 16 20:51:23 .:Catie:.	There is almost definitely a guide out there, absolutely
Nov 16 20:51:31 .:acdw:.	and if you want to send an email to everyone on the list, you email the list itself.
Nov 16 20:51:50 .:binarydigitz01:.	oh
Nov 16 20:52:09 .:binarydigitz01:.	also does the mailing list fills your inbox
Nov 16 20:52:10 .:acdw:.	i would agree with Catie, though: i'm sure there's a guide somewhere if you google it
Nov 16 20:52:21 .:binarydigitz01:.	with loads of messages? if it's a busy message
Nov 16 20:52:25 .:binarydigitz01:.	* busy day
Nov 16 20:52:32 .:acdw:.	binarydigitz01: yeah.... i used to subscribe to emacs' ML but it was a lot
Nov 16 20:52:43 .:acdw:.	i mean i filter lists of course, they go to their own folder. but still
Nov 16 20:53:32 .:heinz9:.	finally I got my ox-hugo working
Nov 16 20:53:40 .:Catie:.	This is the website for the Linux kernel mailing list, but it appears to have _some_ general information on mailing list etiquette: http://vger.kernel.org/lkml/#s3
Nov 16 20:53:43 .:heinz9:.	damn
Nov 16 20:54:19 .:binarydigitz01:.	thanks!
Nov 16 20:54:54 .:Catie:.	I think in general the sort of people who would run a mailing list would also prefer that you use plaintext for your emails, but I don't know that it's necessarily a hard-and-fast rule
Nov 16 20:56:02 .:binarydigitz01:.	Yeah
Nov 16 20:56:12 .:binarydigitz01:.	or maybe org?
Nov 16 20:56:31 .:Catie:.	Org is plaintext! It's markup, but plaintext nonetheless
Nov 16 20:57:05 .:Catie:.	Ah, but I guess the same argument could be made about HTML, huh? Org is at least less obtrusive in many cases
Nov 16 20:57:10 .:acdw:.	well then HTML is plaintext (LOL)
Nov 16 20:57:32 .:acdw:.	org links are pretty intrusive imo,,, i prefer the footnote style[1]
Nov 16 20:57:36 .:acdw:.	[1]: like this
Nov 16 20:57:53 .:Catie:.	acdw: Yeah, I'm also a fan of that
Nov 16 20:58:04 .:binarydigitz01:.	yeah editting around those org links is a nightmare
Nov 16 20:58:08 .:acdw:.	honestly i think email is one place markdown shines
Nov 16 20:58:27 .:acdw:.	which makes sense, it's based on email formatting
Nov 16 20:58:59 .:binarydigitz01:.	markdown shines everywhere where you need very basic word formatting capabilities
Nov 16 20:59:16 .:Catie:.	I do like how it does _emphasis_, but I think if you put a Markdown [link](to-a-website) in an email it can get pretty gross pretty quick
Nov 16 20:59:22 .:acdw:.	i know the big criticism against markdown (well one of them) is that it doesn't do tables right ,,, but i'd argue that if you need to include a table you're past the capabilities of 'plain text'
Nov 16 20:59:36 .:acdw:.	Catie: that's why i use markdown's footnote links
Nov 16 20:59:44 .:acdw:.	i think even Markdown.pl does [1] [1]: ...
Nov 16 20:59:51 .:Catie:.	Oh, Markdown supports those footnotes?
Nov 16 20:59:57 .:Catie:.	Shucks, I'm well out of the loop
Nov 16 21:00:25 .:acdw:.	i know pandoc does... i'm /pretty sure/ all of them do.  It's kinda weird for /valid/ markdown : [link text here][1]
Nov 16 21:00:53 .:acdw:.	but ... i just use plaintext email with markdown-inspired syntax.... getting the meaning across is most important
Nov 16 21:00:56 .:binarydigitz01:.	Can't you bind a key to insert a link in org mode?
Nov 16 21:01:04 .:Catie:.	acdw: Strong agree!
Nov 16 21:01:11 .:acdw:.	binarydigitz01: C-c C-l is the key
Nov 16 21:01:17 .:binarydigitz01:.	yeah
Nov 16 21:01:39 .:acdw:.	i think we're talking about editing org-mode files in non-emacs programs. that is annoying
Nov 16 21:01:43 .:acdw:.	it's a bit verbose
Nov 16 21:02:42 .:binarydigitz01:.	oh
Nov 16 21:02:58 .:binarydigitz01:.	That's where i switch my app to an extension in emacs
Nov 16 21:03:10 .:binarydigitz01:.	\s
Nov 16 21:03:17 .:acdw:.	lol
Nov 16 21:03:24 .:acdw:.	i mean yeah i do try to live in emacs
Nov 16 21:03:49 .:binarydigitz01:.	at this point i treat it as a replacement for bash
Nov 16 21:04:00 .:binarydigitz01:.	I never even tried to learn bash
Nov 16 21:04:07 .:binarydigitz01:.	it looked so ugly to me
Nov 16 21:04:28 .:binarydigitz01:.	so I use helper functions in emacs to do all the work that bash would
Nov 16 21:05:02 .:acdw:.	nice
Nov 16 21:05:12 .:pkal:.	can someone mention my nick quickly
Nov 16 21:05:16 .:Catie:.	pkal
Nov 16 21:05:22 .:pkal:.	Catie: thanks
Nov 16 21:05:29 .:Catie:.	pkal: No worries!
Nov 16 21:05:29 .:acdw:.	pkal!
Nov 16 21:05:31 .:binarydigitz01:.	you're testing notifications too aren't you
Nov 16 21:05:37 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal:
Nov 16 21:06:16 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: I was testing playing a sound on being mentioned.
Nov 16 21:06:29 .:acdw:.	i hope it's a "boop!"
Nov 16 21:06:31 .:matthews:.	if we spam you hard enough, will it play a tune?
Nov 16 21:06:44 .:binarydigitz01:.	lol
Nov 16 21:06:49 .:Catie:.	The One-Note Samba, maybe?
Nov 16 21:06:58 .:pkal:.	matthews: I had to disable it because `play-sound' locks emacs until the sound is done ^^
Nov 16 21:07:17 .:pkal:.	But perhaps if I had a vector of sound files and I used the hash of the nick to select a file...
Nov 16 21:07:38 .:binarydigitz01:.	Can't you make an async function then?
Nov 16 21:08:04 .:pkal:.	It would have to be done in the core, since `play-sound-internal' is a built-in
Nov 16 21:08:29 .:jlf:.	or just issue an async shell cmd to play the audio
Nov 16 21:08:46 .:binarydigitz01:.	☝
Nov 16 21:09:33 .:pkal:.	Not sure how clever it is to have anyone who mentions my name spawn a process on my system...
Nov 16 21:10:07 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: believe it or not, a lot of stuff does that
Nov 16 21:10:21 .:binarydigitz01:.	that's basically how notifications work on android text messaging apps
Nov 16 21:10:36 .:binarydigitz01:.	doesn't matter much if it's a simple boop sound
Nov 16 21:10:38 .:acdw:.	just pipe any message mentioning you to sh
Nov 16 21:11:17 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: an entire process is spawned for every notification?
Nov 16 21:11:40 .:acdw:.	something something unix philosophy
Nov 16 21:11:43 .:binarydigitz01:.	It's not really an entire process
Nov 16 21:12:03 .:binarydigitz01:.	is playing a music file an *entire process*?
Nov 16 21:12:24 .:Catie:.	In an async shell command? Yeah, kind of
Nov 16 21:12:39 .:binarydigitz01:.	hmmm i see
Nov 16 21:12:51 .:binarydigitz01:.	well ig if you use erc
Nov 16 21:12:58 .:binarydigitz01:.	you could just enable the notifications module
Nov 16 21:13:05 .:binarydigitz01:.	which i believe most people would have
Nov 16 21:13:06 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: if I do some mpv ~/sound.ogg, then yes
Nov 16 21:13:18 .:binarydigitz01:.	i see
Nov 16 21:13:24 .:binarydigitz01:.	i have been corrected
Nov 16 21:13:35 .:pkal:.	acdw: I was a fan of the unix philosphy, until I took my first systems programming/operating systems course at university.
Nov 16 21:14:08 .:Catie:.	You could run a custom daemon on your system which listens for commands on a named pipe and plays sounds when it receives them, and set up your IRC client to send commands to the daemon when you get a notification. This would be ridiculous and all sorts of good fun to write
Nov 16 21:14:41 .:binarydigitz01:.	Isn't that basically creating a custom notification system?
Nov 16 21:14:50 .:Catie:.	Yeah!
Nov 16 21:14:55 .:grym:.	ntft.sh to the rescue!
Nov 16 21:15:00 .:grym:.	ntfy.sh ***
Nov 16 21:15:42 .:grym:.	i have been doing things like `make build-container && apprise --title "build status" --body "done" 'ntfy://gryms-super-secret-uuid'`  lately
Nov 16 21:15:45 .:grym:.	<3
Nov 16 21:16:00 .:Catie:.	Oh now this kicks ass
Nov 16 21:16:14 .:grym:.	yer
Nov 16 21:16:31 .:grym:.	and they provide a docker image, it's trivial to host your own ntfy instance
Nov 16 21:16:43 .:Catie:.	Not their logo though, don't like that
Nov 16 21:17:17 .:grym:.	not everyone rates the ultimate logo tier that is https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Nov 16 21:17:40 .:Catie:.	Why would you do this to me
Nov 16 21:17:51 .:grym:.	because "fuck it, just stuff a dict in there" is a fantastic UX for sqlite?
Nov 16 21:18:16 .:grym:.	.upsert_many <3
Nov 16 21:18:33 .:acdw:.	pkal: hm yeah lol. it's not a bad idea per se, but like, it isn't a good hard rule i reckon
Nov 16 21:19:41 .:acdw:.	Catie: can notify-send not already play sounds?
Nov 16 21:19:56 .:Catie:.	acdw: Can't say I've tried it!
Nov 16 21:19:59 .:grym:.	me either
Nov 16 21:20:17 .:ElPresidente:.	grym what in the kentucky fried fuck is that thing
Nov 16 21:20:27 .:binarydigitz01:.	mako doesn't in sway
Nov 16 21:20:29 .:grym:.	ElPresidente: which one, the logo?
Nov 16 21:20:57 .:acdw:.	oh god that logo
Nov 16 21:21:02 .:grym:.	 > Our cute little naked mole rat was drawn by Johannes Koch.
Nov 16 21:21:10 .:ElPresidente:.	yes
Nov 16 21:21:14 .:grym:.	cute lil' guy

Nov 16 21:21:57 .:ElPresidente:.	oh the dark mode made him blue
Nov 16 21:22:02 .:ElPresidente:.	it's significantly better in light mode
Nov 16 21:22:04 .:grym:.	it's an awesome little library though
Nov 16 21:22:13 .:grym:.	part of my sqlite ecosystem for sure
Nov 16 21:22:28 .:grym:.	litecli, sqlite-utils, dataset
Nov 16 21:22:35 .:pkal:.	I've tried using `notifications-notify', but the issue is that GNOME won't display them if Emacs is fullscreened :/
Nov 16 21:23:06 .:acdw:.	is that an emacs issue or a gnome issue? oh i bet gnome b/c the thinking is you don't want notifications over a fullscreen application
Nov 16 21:23:20 .:acdw:.	surely there's a setting for that somewhere
Nov 16 21:25:22 .:pkal:.	I am pretty certain this is a GNOME-ism
Nov 16 21:25:35 .:Keman99:.	Good morning/day/evening to all, anyone having trouble too with erc-sasl.el after updating Emacs within the 28.1 version spectrum?
Nov 16 21:25:55 .:pkal:.	Oh how I wish GNOME used Guile and was openly scriptable.
Nov 16 21:25:57 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: I did not know about that function! tysm!

Nov 16 21:26:05 .:binarydigitz01:.	this seems like such a good function

Nov 16 21:26:29 .:binarydigitz01:.	yeah
Nov 16 21:26:54 .:acdw:.	if gnome used guile that would be pretty dope
Nov 16 21:30:01 .:pkal:.	I wonder who convinced them to use Javascript and CSS instead
Nov 16 21:30:12 .:pkal:.	And that before Electron was a thing
Nov 16 21:31:41 .:binarydigitz01:.	I believe it's a good think they used javascript
Nov 16 21:31:47 .:binarydigitz01:.	*thing
Nov 16 21:31:56 .:binarydigitz01:.	it allows more people to contribute
Nov 16 21:32:26 .:binarydigitz01:.	wait a sec coming right back
Nov 16 21:33:06 .:quiliro:.	Saluton!
Nov 16 21:34:58 .:pkal:.	The real issue was that netscape didn't use Scheme, but created Javascript instead.

Nov 16 21:42:11 .:e1f:.	" I was recruited to Netscape with the promise of “doing Scheme” in the browser. "
Nov 16 21:42:13 .:pkal:.	I find it hard to reconsile the image of a mainstream web developer with that scheme hacker
Nov 16 21:42:27 .:technomancy:.	that's because we're in the Bad Timeline
Nov 16 21:43:15 .:e1f:.	as he says, they baited him to come work at netscape by saying they wanted scheme in the browser

Nov 16 21:43:48 .:acdw:.	!!!

Nov 16 21:44:37 .:pkal:.	Let's add Scheme-scripting support to eww and build our own web
Nov 16 21:45:05 .:grym:.	technomancy: https://0x0.st/oIpD.jpg

Nov 16 21:50:23 .:oats:.	hehe
Nov 16 21:50:43 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: I have never experienced the old internet, but I seriously believe that people abuse scripting languages
Nov 16 21:50:51 .:binarydigitz01:.	and the old internet was better
Nov 16 21:51:00 .:acdw:.	let's replace HTML with bash
Nov 16 21:51:08 .:pkal:.	I haven't experienced it either, beyond visiting old sites.
Nov 16 21:51:23 .:e1f:.	instead of html, why not emacs buffer properties?
Nov 16 21:51:34 .:pkal:.	Or rather depends on what you mean by old.  I was using the web around 2002, but had no idea what was what
Nov 16 21:51:48 .:binarydigitz01:.	Most popular websites ruin the experience with javascript. I would rather have speedy static sites than slow js ones
Nov 16 21:52:13 .:binarydigitz01:.	like wikipedia
Nov 16 21:52:18 .:binarydigitz01:.	wikipedia is fast
Nov 16 21:52:24 .:e1f:.	js because those sites support mobile and desktop
Nov 16 21:53:26 .:wgreenhouse:.	the old internet involved scary nonsense like Flash and Java applets
Nov 16 21:53:33 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: The question is, is all javascript harmful?  I don't think so.  A lot of what slows down the modern web is (for the user) pointless stuff like tracking and advertising
Nov 16 21:55:50 .:NotThatRPG:.	quick question: does emacs lisp have symbol macros?  (I'm looking for a way to alias variables )
Nov 16 21:57:55 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: all javascript may not be harmful, but still companies exploit it
Nov 16 21:57:56 .:thblt:.	NotThatRPG: no, but defalias?
Nov 16 21:57:59 .:acdw:.	not sure about symbol macros but there is defvaralias
Nov 16 21:58:22 .:NotThatRPG:.	acdw: I didn't know that! Thanks!
Nov 16 22:07:40 .:wasamasa:.	NotThatRPG: have you tried cl-symbol-macrolet?
Nov 16 22:17:59 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: Right, and my question is how we can get the good parts while preventing exploitation.
Nov 16 22:22:49 .:wasamasa:.	binarydigitz01: you forgot how ad-infested the old internet was?
Nov 16 22:23:18 .:EdwardIII:.	hmm how come (string-match  (rx (group  (+ digit))) "23. hello world") returns 0?
Nov 16 22:23:20 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: Honestly not sure
Nov 16 22:24:01 .:binarydigitz01:.	wasamasa: like i said before i have not experienced the old internet first hand
Nov 16 22:24:24 .:wasamasa:.	EdwardIII: it returns the index of the match
Nov 16 22:24:32 .:EdwardIII:.	ah rats
Nov 16 22:24:39 .:wasamasa:.	if there's no match, you get no number
Nov 16 22:25:12 .:wasamasa:.	there are some very impressive websites using html5 and css3 features to make the most of no JS
Nov 16 22:25:39 .:wasamasa:.	because of the motivation to mitigate XSS and other client-side attacks enabled by JS
Nov 16 22:26:32 .:EdwardIII:.	wasamasa: is there a help page i can look at that might point me to a function which returns a list of capture group results from a string?
Nov 16 22:26:52 .:wasamasa:.	yes, there's the elisp reference explaining all that
Nov 16 22:27:16 .:binarydigitz01:.	wasamasa: cool!
Nov 16 22:27:39 .:wasamasa:.	(info "(elisp) Simple Match Data")
Nov 16 22:28:25 .:wasamasa:.	(info "(elisp) Entire Match Data")
Nov 16 22:29:32 .:lechner:.	Hi, after many years with Git I finally had the courage to spend some time with Magit. What a game changer!
Nov 16 22:30:40 .:binarydigitz01:.	Magit's such a time saver
Nov 16 22:30:50 .:binarydigitz01:.	couldn't live without it
Nov 16 22:31:06 .:EdwardIII:.	wasamasa: i did see match-data etc but is there anything a bit less satanic? like something that returns rather than needing to do another lookup afterwards and hoping the state is the same
Nov 16 22:31:22 .:wasamasa:.	doesn't seem so
Nov 16 22:31:31 .:EdwardIII:.	right-o
Nov 16 22:31:32 .:wasamasa:.	but in practice, people just look at specific groups
Nov 16 22:32:00 .:wasamasa:.	yes, match state in emacs is global state
Nov 16 22:32:17 .:wasamasa:.	if you wonder why multithreading is so hard, this is one of the reasons
Nov 16 22:32:24 .:EdwardIII:.	heh i can well believe it
Nov 16 22:32:42 .:wasamasa:.	the solution is that each thread gets its own match state
Nov 16 22:32:44 .:EdwardIII:.	just having a peep in cl-lib to see if there's something a bit nicer
Nov 16 22:33:07 .:bpalmer:.	EdwardIII: you can write your own function that just matches and returns match-data
Nov 16 22:33:39 .:wasamasa:.	one other consequence is that some functions expect you to not clobber the match state
Nov 16 22:34:04 .:wasamasa:.	emacs has been trying to detect this because it leads to tricky bugs
Nov 16 22:36:08 .:NotThatRPG:.	wasamasa: Thanks!~
Nov 16 22:43:48 .:heinz9:.	my emacs freezes when editing sometimes
Nov 16 22:43:51 .:heinz9:.	what shall I do
Nov 16 22:43:56 .:wasamasa:.	despair
Nov 16 22:43:57 .:heinz9:.	someone told me a key combo
Nov 16 22:44:14 .:Catie:.	C-g or ESC a few times, maybe?
Nov 16 22:44:16 .:wasamasa:.	,C-g
Nov 16 22:44:17 .:fsbot:.	ESC ESC ESC GODDAMNIT C-g C-g WAKE THE F*** UP
Nov 16 22:44:31 .:binarydigitz01:.	profiler-start
Nov 16 22:44:38 .:binarydigitz01:.	then do typing
Nov 16 22:44:44 .:binarydigitz01:.	then when it freezes agian
Nov 16 22:44:54 .:binarydigitz01:.	profiler-stop
Nov 16 22:45:08 .:binarydigitz01:.	then look at what function is hogging up your resources
Nov 16 22:45:23 .:binarydigitz01:.	if you can't figure out, then you switch to doom emacs
Nov 16 22:45:30 .:zebrag:.	unplug/replug the pc?
Nov 16 22:45:31 .:pkal:.	*profiler-report, right?
Nov 16 22:45:35 .:binarydigitz01:.	yeah
Nov 16 22:46:09 .:binarydigitz01:.	wait no
Nov 16 22:46:11 .:binarydigitz01:.	profiler stop
Nov 16 22:46:15 .:binarydigitz01:.	then profiler report

Nov 16 22:47:39 .:fsbot:.	Among the lucky, you are the chosen one.
Nov 16 22:47:49 .:binarydigitz01:.	I could do this all day
Nov 16 22:48:05 .:Catie:.	binarydigitz01: You mentioned having an "IRC noob moment" a bit ago, you spend a lot of time on Discord?
Nov 16 22:48:20 .:lechner:.	Hi, some glyphs are missing from my Emacs, especially in IRC and the modeline for display-wttr. Do I need more fonts?
Nov 16 22:48:25 .:binarydigitz01:.	kinda yeah.
Nov 16 22:48:36 .:binarydigitz01:.	mostly all my text messaging experience is from discord
Nov 16 22:48:49 .:binarydigitz01:.	but then I read about discord being spyware, so I'm trying to leave it
Nov 16 22:49:42 .:Catie:.	binarydigitz01: We don't really like serieses(sp?) of short messages here separated by RET here, it's generally preferred that you put everything you're trying to say in one message when possible
Nov 16 22:49:42 .:pkal:.	1+ great to hear that
Nov 16 22:50:11 .:Catie:.	lechner: More fonts is a good place to start! Do the glyphs display in other programs and it's just Emacs that doesn't show them?
Nov 16 22:50:23 .:binarydigitz01:.	oh i see, guess I'll try to condense my messages in the future
Nov 16 22:50:29 .:heinz9:.	you key combo helped, but it continues freezing again and again and I need this key combo again and again
Nov 16 22:50:43 .:Catie:.	binarydigitz01: Hell yeah! Good to have you out of the Discord wasteland
Nov 16 22:50:56 .:lechner:.	+1
Nov 16 22:50:58 .:binarydigitz01:.	thanks!
Nov 16 22:51:26 .:pkal:.	I wish it would be that easy to make people I know stop using discord by pointing out it was spyware...
Nov 16 22:51:44 .:Catie:.	pkal: Oh huge agree! I've been trying to get my friends off of Discord, but alas
Nov 16 22:51:46 .:hodapp:.	I know it's spyware, the problem is that I still need it to communicate with certain people
Nov 16 22:51:53 .:technomancy:.	pkal: there's always https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord
Nov 16 22:52:29 .:Catie:.	technomancy: Ooh, this is good! Definitely spreading this one around
Nov 16 22:52:42 .:binarydigitz01:.	hodapp: I feel you man. My country uses whatsapp as a standard for messaging
Nov 16 22:52:53 .:binarydigitz01:.	and I really hate it, but i have to use it.
Nov 16 22:52:56 .:grym:.	could be worse, could be wechat
Nov 16 22:53:14 .:pkal:.	technomancy: I've also seen https://usemumble.neocities.org/ that is more chaotic
Nov 16 22:53:19 .:oats:.	weechat > wechat
Nov 16 22:53:21 .:heinz9:.	I even can not save my document
Nov 16 22:53:30 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: Germany?
Nov 16 22:53:33 .:grym:.	and critically, weechat != wechat
Nov 16 22:54:41 .:Catie:.	heinz9: There are a lot of things that could be locking up Emacs, and I have absolutely no idea where to start on that. Running the profiler, as mentioned, might show you what's eating up your system. Has anyone else debugged this sort of thing before?
Nov 16 22:54:49 .:binarydigitz01:.	pkal: India
Nov 16 22:55:40 .:lechner:.	Catie / they are missing just in Emacs
Nov 16 22:55:59 .:binarydigitz01:.	Catie: I have always thought about it this way, something capable of locking emacs would also be very heavy on the cpu usage
Nov 16 22:57:03 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: I remember hearing that WA was big over there too
Nov 16 22:57:18 .:Catie:.	lechner: Hmm, that's interesting. If you have the point on one of the missing glyphs and do M-x describe-char, does it tell you anything about how it's trying to display the character?
Nov 16 22:57:24 .:pkal:.	I am uncertain if Discord or WhatsApp is less preferable.  At least Discord has bots...
Nov 16 22:57:48 .:Catie:.	binarydigitz01: Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me, I'm just not familiar enough with Emacs' debugging facilities to know whether there's something more specialized or not
Nov 16 22:58:26 .:binarydigitz01:.	whatsapp is owned by facebook 😒 . That's enough for me to not use it
Nov 16 23:01:31 .:lechner:.	Catie / it says display: no font.     no laughing please, straight from another channel     https://www.pastery.net/tmrktn/
Nov 16 23:02:14 .:lechner:.	Catie / forgot to say, thanks for the hint!
Nov 16 23:03:03 .:lechner:.	the straightface from binarydigitz01 showed just above
Nov 16 23:03:37 .:binarydigitz01:.	nice!
Nov 16 23:04:16 .:lechner:.	name: UNAMUSED FACE    that display-char hint rocks!
Nov 16 23:04:28 .:Catie:.	lechner: It's one of my favorite commands
Nov 16 23:04:45 .:lechner:.	Catie / i am with you!
Nov 16 23:06:19 .:binarydigitz01:.	What do you guys feel about matrix?
Nov 16 23:07:48 .:Catie:.	I prefer it to Discord just on principle, but I haven't really used it enough to form a really strong opinion of it
Nov 16 23:07:56 .:grym:.	feels like a pile of jank
Nov 16 23:08:03 .:grym:.	and one i don't need to eat, today
Nov 16 23:08:31 .:oats:.	binarydigitz01, neat, promising
Nov 16 23:08:50 .:oats:.	there may in fact be matricers amogus
Nov 16 23:09:03 .:grym:.	bridges ... weirdly ... to irc
Nov 16 23:09:18 .:lechner:.	oats / are you?
Nov 16 23:09:24 .:Catie:.	I'll absolutely agree that the bridging feels quite janky
Nov 16 23:09:43 .:binarydigitz01:.	I feel like matrix will eventually supersede irc, it feels way better in terms of UX
Nov 16 23:10:09 .:binarydigitz01:.	One problem I have with IRC is we don't get to see past messages unless you host a server
Nov 16 23:10:26 .:Catie:.	For many, that's a feature rather than a bug
Nov 16 23:10:31 .:oats:.	binarydigitz01, there's a reason this comic exists https://xkcd.com/1782/
Nov 16 23:11:35 .:lechner:.	binarydigitz01 / your caveat is true for this channel, but many others encourage public logging
Nov 16 23:11:46 .:binarydigitz01:.	oats: lol
Nov 16 23:11:54 .:oats:.	also, public bouncer services do exist
Nov 16 23:12:16 .:binarydigitz01:.	Catie: how is that  a feature?
Nov 16 23:12:25 .:pkal:.	binarydigitz01: That might, but probably won't, change with the adoption of IRCv3
Nov 16 23:12:28 .:oats:.	chat.sr.ht comes to mind
Nov 16 23:12:36 .:binarydigitz01:.	ooh that seems nice
Nov 16 23:12:42 .:oats:.	binarydigitz01, if you want a "modern" gui and don't mind self hosting, check out TheLounge
Nov 16 23:12:49 .:oats:.	gives you a nice webui/bouncer for IRC
Nov 16 23:13:25 .:Catie:.	Not everyone wants their messages to be preserved for eternity. It's not something that would bother me personally, but rather something I was told a while back
Nov 16 23:13:43 .:pkal:.	My university had an IRC network for chat, but opted for Rocket Chat when the pandemic began, instead of setting up a TheLounge server, which I htink would have been a lot better.
Nov 16 23:14:06 .:oats:.	ehhhhhh
Nov 16 23:14:31 .:oats:.	most people aren't gonna enjoy using IRC, let's be realistic here
Nov 16 23:14:33 .:binarydigitz01:.	Catie: well, maybe don't save the messages for eternity, but save them for just an hour or 2 so the new people that join can get some context
Nov 16 23:15:11 .:Catie:.	binarydigitz01: That's also an option! And certainly not impossible
Nov 16 23:15:23 .:wasamasa:.	yes, some ircds do offer that
Nov 16 23:15:29 .:wasamasa:.	requires ircv3 support though
Nov 16 23:17:23 .:binarydigitz01:.	hmm, guess i'll look into that
Nov 16 23:20:01 .:wasamasa:.	so if both client and server support it, you get some scrollback and can request/get more scrollback
Nov 16 23:23:00 .:clemens3:.	actually the move from freenode to libera dropped lotsa bots and some idlers, imho i think quality has gone up a little bit
Nov 16 23:23:36 .:clemens3:.	if ppl now think irc is not too fashinable, the better
Nov 16 23:24:40 .:binarydigitz01:.	Honestly, I don't care what medium I use to converse
Nov 16 23:24:51 .:binarydigitz01:.	it just shouldn't steal my data
Nov 16 23:25:23 .:binarydigitz01:.	at this point the only 2 proprietry services i still use are youtube and reddit, and i plan to kill them asap
Nov 16 23:26:37 .:wasamasa:.	I must say, I'm a lot less stressed ever since I stopped moderating r/emacs
Nov 16 23:26:57 .:EdwardIII:.	what made it stressful? just having to take the time to do it?
Nov 16 23:27:37 .:oats:.	it sounds like a fair bit of work
Nov 16 23:27:55 .:wasamasa:.	people expect you to resolve whatever they disagree with quick, you need to read the entirety of r/emacs to properly judge the disagreements and then there's the judging itself you do
Nov 16 23:27:56 .:Catie:.	Moderation on its own seems like an insurmountably difficult task
Nov 16 23:28:32 .:binarydigitz01:.	I always thought that emacs was a very tame subreddit
Nov 16 23:28:34 .:wasamasa:.	I've explained my overall strategy to it in a post for recruiting new moderators which is basically, let people do things as long as they're not making a lot of people uncomfortable for no good reason
Nov 16 23:28:58 .:wasamasa:.	because it's otherwise a slippery slope of deciding what's acceptable and what isn't
Nov 16 23:29:14 .:wasamasa:.	basically, keep people from becoming too heated in discussions
Nov 16 23:29:40 .:wasamasa:.	there was automated moderation from reddit itself hiding people's posts and submissions, so you needed to approve them regularly
Nov 16 23:29:52 .:wasamasa:.	or check whether there's a reason for this to happen, like someone being shadowbanned
Nov 16 23:30:10 .:grym:.	"They kind of care about money, but mostly they wish you would shut up and be civil."
Nov 16 23:30:13 .:wasamasa:.	at some point people expected to just directly message me for favors like stickying submissions
Nov 16 23:30:35 .:binarydigitz01:.	that's tough
Nov 16 23:30:50 .:wasamasa:.	I think mastodon is worse
Nov 16 23:30:52 .:Catie:.	And completely thankless
Nov 16 23:31:10 .:wasamasa:.	because of the tendency of people to form groups to voice their opinions with
Nov 16 23:31:21 .:wasamasa:.	whereas on r/emacs they had opinions, but rarely went through with them
Nov 16 23:32:02 .:wasamasa:.	I realized one day that doing this on the side did not make me happy and did not really rely on me either, so I decided to pass the torch
Nov 16 23:32:13 .:yates:.	is there a function like shell-command-to-string but which returns the stderr instead of stdout?
Nov 16 23:32:20 .:lechner:.	wasamasa / i live near Facebook and heard that over ninety percent of people there work as moderators of some type
Nov 16 23:32:40 .:grym:.	lechner: for now!
Nov 16 23:32:57 .:lechner:.	pre-layoffs, you mean?
Nov 16 23:33:06 .:acdw:.	i'm starting to consider using which-function-mode as a word count
Nov 16 23:33:08 .:wasamasa:.	yates: you could do some redirection tricks
Nov 16 23:33:16 .:acdw:.	(ab)using it
Nov 16 23:33:39 .:grym:.	wasamasa: https://nitter.it/pic/orig/enc/bWVkaWEvRlFZbnZuYVZrQU0xSnh4LmpwZw== ?
Nov 16 23:33:40 .:wasamasa:.	yates: otherwise, use processes directly
Nov 16 23:33:46 .:grym:.	lechner: twitter joke
Nov 16 23:33:46 .:yates:.	wasamasa: true. but after i asked this question i thought of another solution.
Nov 16 23:35:00 .:wasamasa:.	grym: I've been thinking recently just how much about moderation being annoying is the result of Americans being obsessed with the first amendment thing (which only protects them from governments anyway, lol)
Nov 16 23:35:08 .:yates:.	i'm executing my own c++ code, i'll just put an option to suppress everything except the result to stdout
Nov 16 23:35:21 .:acdw:.	wasamasa: that's a good guess
Nov 16 23:35:28 .:grym:.	wasamasa: my money's on "not very much"
Nov 16 23:35:42 .:wasamasa:.	the looney types seem to like the idea a lot
Nov 16 23:35:58 .:grym:.	but culture leaks, and you get people in tajikstan or w/e complaining on arrest that they haven't been properly mirandized
Nov 16 23:36:05 .:grym:.	so... at some point, it's hard to say
Nov 16 23:37:43 .:grym:.	'fuck you, i do/say what i want' is perhaps held up some times as a particularly american attitude, but i've never been amazingly convinced that it's uniquely so
Nov 16 23:38:04 .:acdw:.	the anonymity of the internet helps too, with the dickishness
Nov 16 23:38:16 .:acdw:.	i don't know enough about non-american culture to say one way or the other

Nov 17 02:30:44 .:mechalain:.	you can specify unicde names with ?/{NAME} if that helps?
Nov 17 02:30:44 .:mekeor[m]:.	vuori: actually, since executing that command, mu does not find any mails in that maildir anymore
Nov 17 02:31:13 .:mekeor[m]:.	vuori: it does not. but maybe its just me. mmm
Nov 17 02:32:02 .:vuori:.	I have only briefly tried mu, but basically mflag just appends "S" to the filenames of Maildir mails
Nov 17 02:33:24 .:mekeor[m]:.	vuori: oh, it actually worked. i needed to restart mu somehow. sorry for false alarm!
Nov 17 02:33:46 .:mekeor[m]:.	for the record, i ran mlist -s . | mflag -S # note the dot
Nov 17 02:42:16 .:subopt:.	Looking for a way to automatically rename some specific buffers (whose files have really long names) upon opening their files.
Nov 17 02:43:26 .:e1f:.	it would have to be a hook for the mode you're in; the hook would check the file-length and then rename the buffer
Nov 17 02:43:37 .:e1f:.	filename-length*
Nov 17 02:44:56 .:subopt:.	e1f: was thinking more along the lines of a list of (from to) pairs. Thought there was a built-in way to do this, but can't find it.

Nov 17 02:46:06 .:e1f:.	generate-new-buffer-name
Nov 17 02:46:33 .:e1f:.	then the hook would have to be for fundamental-mode from which all modes inherit
Nov 17 02:47:11 .:acdw:.	maybe find-file-hook, there isn't a fundamental-mode-hook iirc
Nov 17 02:47:31 .:e1f:.	oh, that's a surprise
Nov 17 02:47:44 .:acdw:.	fundamental-mode isn't really a /mode/, per se
Nov 17 02:47:48 .:e1f:.	there must be a mode that all buffers inherit and which has a hook
Nov 17 02:47:55 .:e1f:.	ah
Nov 17 02:48:07 .:e1f:.	one of emacs' quirky nuances
Nov 17 02:48:08 .:acdw:.	hmm it does do (run-mode-hooks)
Nov 17 02:48:36 .:tusko:.	I used to smell like hot dorritos, and then emacs came into my life.

Nov 17 03:00:13 .:parsnip:.	i'm cracking up
Nov 17 03:00:29 .:parsnip:.	starting out pretty funny
Nov 17 03:07:00 .:parsnip:.	i feel like i need to actually go watch these kanye interviews now
Nov 17 03:07:09 .:parsnip:.	because it seems jon stewart did
Nov 17 03:21:18 .:parsnip:.	i don't look forward to watching those interviews, but someday i'll get to it
Nov 17 03:33:22 .:parsnip:.	rudybot: condescension is an essential form of communication
Nov 17 03:33:22 .:rudybot:.	parsnip: Oh yes.  You can feel quite positive about your inferiors, and even bring yourself down to their level for some things, a virtue known as "condescension."
Nov 17 03:35:11 .:twb:.	I guess etymologically that means "going down together"
Nov 17 03:41:20 .:parsnip:.	good lord, i have an email thread 20 messages long now, i've repeatedly asked for a return authorization number, they're asking me stupid shit like do i have family or friends, and are now replying to all questions with, "this will be discussed over phone"
Nov 17 03:41:38 .:parsnip:.	sounds like they just want to continue telling me what they want over the phone
Nov 17 03:41:45 .:parsnip:.	what's the fucking point
Nov 17 03:42:37 .:twb:.	Whatcha returning?
Nov 17 03:47:40 .:parsnip:.	i have Shokz OpenRun. I'm fine with them, but the microphone doesn't work. i thought that was just to be expected, because waterproof. but then i saw youtube videos where people review this exact model, and microphone seems to work. so if they are intended to work, i'd be curious to have a working model
Nov 17 03:49:00 .:parsnip:.	and fucking email thread, they keep trying to dictate how things will go, and i'm like, i'm under the impression there is a perfectly convenient route for this to go, and they are just being very vague and avoiding replying to questions, now they want to be vague and avoid questions _over the phone_
Nov 17 03:49:05 .:parsnip:.	yeah, that sounds like a great idea
Nov 17 03:59:18 .:parsnip:.	i just forwarded the email to bestbuy asking them for advice, and cc'd shokz
Nov 17 04:00:43 .:parsnip:.	we're all savage animals
Nov 17 04:01:58 .:twb:.	interesting you have to talk to the manufacturer at all
Nov 17 04:02:19 .:twb:.	under Australian consumer law, if a product is not "fit for purpose" and it's <$10,000, the *retailer* has to refund your money
Nov 17 04:04:00 .:bremner:.	everyone knows Australia is Utopia
Nov 17 04:04:19 .:bremner:.	I saw movie. Something about a fence. Or maybe Mad Max.
Nov 17 04:04:21 .:bpalmer:.	especially for spiders
Nov 17 04:05:01 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: how many eight eyed people do you see on a daily basis?
Nov 17 04:05:01 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: Ugh, I'm listening to a feat black eyed peas version. This I don't like.
Nov 17 04:05:02 .:bremner:.	someone should make "Rabbit Proof Fence", but about Canadian residential schools, to shut those smug Canadians up
Nov 17 04:05:24 .:bpalmer:.	wait, do canadian schools teach proofs to rabbits?
Nov 17 04:05:46 .:bremner:.	hard to tell with the masks on
Nov 17 04:05:53 .:parsnip:.	everyone knows that credit cards get you special service
Nov 17 04:06:09 .:bpalmer:.	rabbits are terrible credit risks.
Nov 17 04:06:34 .:bpalmer:.	companies that lend them money are just begging to take a harecut
Nov 17 04:08:55 .:twb:.	bremner: most Americans only saw Mad Max 2 which is sort of like only seeing Evil Dead 2
Nov 17 04:10:29 .:parsnip:.	what was the brad pitt and antonio banderos trilogy?
Nov 17 04:10:40 .:twb:.	El Mariachi?
Nov 17 04:10:48 .:parsnip:.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_Trilogy
Nov 17 04:10:53 .:parsnip:.	yes
Nov 17 04:11:03 .:twb:.	The first one is just so much better
Nov 17 04:11:18 .:twb:.	The later ones were made for non-Mexicans so are crap
Nov 17 04:11:29 .:bpalmer:.	What, Mexico is pretty fine, but New Mexico is great.
Nov 17 04:11:39 .:bremner:.	was it the third mad max that made all the bros so angry?
Nov 17 04:11:47 .:parsnip:.	hmm, brad pitt was not in it. what am i thinking of
Nov 17 04:11:53 .:wgreenhouse:.	twb: yeah, casting Keanu as the CIA villain was smart, in the first one
Nov 17 04:12:10 .:parsnip:.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mexican
Nov 17 04:12:52 .:parsnip:.	the third was with Tina Turner?
Nov 17 04:13:00 .:parsnip:.	thunderdome?
Nov 17 04:13:02 .:twb:.	wgreenhouse: I don't think Moco looks like keanu reeves
Nov 17 04:14:32 .:parsnip:.	not to be confused with ThunderDome Tacoma
Nov 17 04:15:53 .:Mrtn[m]:.	twb: It's the other way around, as you see it?
Nov 17 04:20:41 .:bpalmer:.	Hmm. Musk claims  on the stand again today that his SEC settlement with the government doesn't count, because it was "under duress."
Nov 17 04:24:32 .:bremner:.	beatings will continue until management skills improve
Nov 17 04:25:15 .:grym:.	good news for every person who took a plea bargain!
Nov 17 04:25:22 .:slondr:.	any reason to prefer an emacs gui compilation target vs the others for touch-screen use?
Nov 17 04:25:22 .:grym:.	elon ending the prison industrial complex!
Nov 17 04:25:35 .:slondr:.	grym: wow, critical support for elon
Nov 17 04:25:50 .:bpalmer:.	but he also says that he (a) doesn't want to be CEO of any company; and (b) he doesn't really care about money, he just requires outlandish compensation so he can fund a mars colony.
Nov 17 04:26:26 .:technomancy:.	bpalmer: that actually sounds a lot like the backstory of the primary antagonist of the latest season of Star Trek Discovery tbh
Nov 17 04:26:31 .:technomancy:.	except he's a lot more likeable
Nov 17 04:26:49 .:bpalmer:.	is Discovery the one set when Vulcans discovered Earth?
Nov 17 04:27:28 .:technomancy:.	no, Discovery jumped to 900 years later than the other ones
Nov 17 04:28:07 .:bpalmer:.	ah. I stopped paying attention to star trek
Nov 17 04:28:15 .:bpalmer:.	too many series
Nov 17 04:28:19 .:technomancy:.	fair
Nov 17 04:28:25 .:technomancy:.	Lower Decks is totally worth it tho
Nov 17 04:28:28 .:bremner:.	Star Trek Parallel ftw
Nov 17 04:32:12 .:parsnip:.	animated programs are recorded WITH SHOUTING!
Nov 17 04:32:20 .:parsnip:.	can't stand 'em
Nov 17 04:32:32 .:technomancy:.	https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ruon_Tarka
Nov 17 04:32:34 .:parsnip:.	i first noticed this with Archer
Nov 17 04:32:42 .:parsnip:.	and now i can't unhear it
Nov 17 04:33:26 .:twb:.	parsnip: you want a dull monotone?
Nov 17 04:34:12 .:parsnip:.	twb: idk, every other type of program or movie sounds fine. but the voice actors in animated programs sound like they're screaming directly into a microphone
Nov 17 04:34:39 »»	parsnip makes horse sounds with coconuts
Nov 17 04:34:41 .:twb:.	sounds like a mixing issue to me
Nov 17 04:35:46 .:parsnip:.	twb: probably because animated programs put the voice actors in a sound booth with a microphone, whereas most acting is just folks talking to each other in a setting, with microphones hanging overhead
Nov 17 04:35:46 .:technomancy:.	Archer the show or Archer the captain of the NX-01 Enterprise?
Nov 17 04:35:52 .:parsnip:.	Archer the show
Nov 17 04:36:35 .:parsnip:.	i have this issue with multiple animated programs, Archer and The Lower Decks are two shows that seem otherwise great, but i just cannot stand how loud they sound
Nov 17 04:36:56 .:parsnip:.	i don't remember noticing this with years of watching Simpson's
Nov 17 04:37:13 .:parsnip:.	Archer triggered this in my brain
Nov 17 04:37:15 .:twb:.	mixing issue
Nov 17 04:38:54 .:parsnip:.	i think the enunciation gets messed up too
Nov 17 04:39:05 .:parsnip:.	like i don't need to hear a piercing "t" sound, etc
Nov 17 04:39:26 .:parsnip:.	which seems like it could be a sound booth issue
Nov 17 04:39:49 .:parsnip:.	all the consonants are loud af
Nov 17 04:40:05 .:twb:.	parsnip: blame the sound engineer
Nov 17 04:40:14 .:parsnip:.	probably
Nov 17 04:40:27 .:twb:.	was it the same person on both shows
Nov 17 04:40:54 .:parsnip:.	i think it's also like if you talk with earplugs
Nov 17 04:41:13 .:parsnip:.	they probably are in the sound booth with huge headphones, and not actually talking to one another
Nov 17 04:41:39 .:parsnip:.	they should just sit in a set stage like in the cosby show
Nov 17 04:41:43 .:wgreenhouse:.	voice acting for animation is more like theater acting, also.
Nov 17 04:42:03 .:wgreenhouse:.	in terms of some of these tropes about delivery
Nov 17 04:42:08 .:wgreenhouse:.	more overstated
Nov 17 04:43:02 .:twb:.	parsnip: uh, often they are in the same booth
Nov 17 04:43:14 .:twb:.	e.g. Mark Hamill definitely was when doing VA for batman
Nov 17 04:44:27 .:parsnip:.	did Mark Hamill disappear for years? did he run out of money and come back to publicity?
Nov 17 04:45:20 .:twb:.	parsnip: he got a facial scar in a road accident
Nov 17 04:45:27 .:twb:.	parsnip: after that he mostly did voice work
Nov 17 04:45:42 .:twb:.	He is very well known as Joker since the 1990s
Nov 17 04:46:09 .:bpalmer:.	Mark Hamill has acted very consistently since star wars.
Nov 17 04:46:37 .:twb:.	bpalmer: like... always putting the toilet seat down, always double-parking on sundays?
Nov 17 04:46:53 .:bpalmer:.	as for running out of money ... while it's a definite worry given he was in such low grossing films like Return of the Jedi, which has yet to show a profit, there's never been any public sign of it.
Nov 17 04:47:47 .:parsnip:.	i usually flip a coin
Nov 17 04:48:43 .:bpalmer:.	no, Richard Moll is the voice of Two Face.
Nov 17 04:49:10 .:grym:.	https://i.imgur.com/T0w5i0L.jpeg  :(
Nov 17 04:49:15 .:grym:.	and batman lost his
Nov 17 04:49:16 .:bpalmer:.	Hamill is The Joker, Swamp Thing, and the Trickster
Nov 17 04:49:33 .:Jefe:.	A quick Google search shows Mark Hamill's net worth is $18 million.
Nov 17 04:49:45 .:bpalmer:.	grym: :-( aye.
Nov 17 04:50:51 .:twb:.	grym: what I wanted was for Adam West / Mark Hamill double bill
Nov 17 04:51:07 .:bpalmer:.	twb: there was an episode of B:TAS for that
Nov 17 04:51:25 .:bpalmer:.	in fact, I think tha tmight be what that image is from?
Nov 17 04:52:21 .:bpalmer:.	ah, no, Batman: Brave and the Bold. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_of_the_Night!
Nov 17 04:52:39 .:twb:.	bpalmer: ah that was after my time
Nov 17 04:52:43 .:bpalmer:.	and I'm mixing up episodes
Nov 17 04:52:43 .:grym:.	the image i linked is, i believe, very well done fan art https://nitter.it/WhyNotStuff/status/1591823646410313728#m
Nov 17 04:53:06 .:bpalmer:.	I'm mixing up Chill of the Night! with an episode where Batman protects an old superhero actor
Nov 17 04:53:15 .:grym:.	oh i dimly remember that
Nov 17 04:53:16 .:twb:.	bpalmer: ugh fucking Hale is in that
Nov 17 04:53:24 .:grym:.	i haven't rewatched the animated series in a looong tiem
Nov 17 04:53:38 .:twb:.	I wouldn't mind her if she wasn't UBIQUITOUS in the 201x's

Nov 17 05:22:20 .:lockywolf:.	I don't think many people seriously developed touch capabilities of Emacs

Nov 17 06:56:31 .:TehBoss:.	yo, is someone on here able to edit the erc SASL tutorial on the libera.chat website?
Nov 17 06:57:01 .:TehBoss:.	cos in the guide it tells you to redefine the erc-tls command to include ur password but thats not necessary
Nov 17 07:12:51 .:lockywolf:.	well, did something similar: added %b\n to the org-agenda-prefix-format
Nov 17 07:13:01 .:lockywolf:.	looks a little ugly, but works
Nov 17 07:16:22 .:lockywolf:.	Is it true that with Linux 6.0, there is no need to use dtoverlays on Raspberry Pi 4?
Nov 17 07:16:44 .:lockywolf:.	I saw some entries mentioning V3D support in the kernel.
Nov 17 07:17:07 .:lockywolf:.	Generally, has anyone made 4k video work on Rpi4?
Nov 17 07:38:02 .:wgreenhouse:.	4k of 2d-accelerated desktop effects, maybe
Nov 17 07:51:12 .:twb:.	lockywolf: don't rpi need non-free shit to do hw video decoding
Nov 17 07:52:20 .:lockywolf:.	twb: not really. there is this "non-free shit", called mmal, which you can buy from Qualcomm (afair), but it only works on 32bits, so is irrelevant anyway
Nov 17 07:53:09 .:lockywolf:.	however, there are v4l2m2m and v4l2m2m-copy hw acceleration methods
Nov 17 07:54:02 .:lockywolf:.	I managed to make them work once, sort of, with a hacked outdated ffmpeg, and I suspect, imperfectly
Nov 17 07:55:14 .:lockywolf:.	but apart from acceleration, there is the problem of plain opening such a resolution on the screen
Nov 17 07:55:42 .:lockywolf:.	there is this KMS/fKMS dtoverlay mumbo-jumbo
Nov 17 07:57:18 .:lockywolf:.	apparently, there is a lot of creepy stuff under the hood in the RPi firmware
Nov 17 07:57:30 .:lockywolf:.	so I have 'dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d-pi4,cma=512'
Nov 17 07:57:46 .:lockywolf:.	and hdmi_enable_4kp60=1
Nov 17 07:57:52 .:lockywolf:.	in /boot/config.txt
Nov 17 07:58:52 .:lockywolf:.	and gpu_mem=128
Nov 17 07:59:02 .:lockywolf:.	which all do not make any sense
Nov 17 08:00:27 .:lockywolf:.	generally, with hw decoding, RPi4 should be capable of 4k@60fps for x264,x265
Nov 17 08:03:34 .:technomancy:.	rpi needs non-free shit just to boot; it's bananas
Nov 17 08:06:18 .:lockywolf:.	https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/5178
Nov 17 08:06:26 .:lockywolf:.	this kind of problems, lol
Nov 17 08:16:45 .:twb:.	lockywolf: wait QCA?
Nov 17 08:16:53 .:twb:.	lockywolf: I thought rpi was a bcm shop
Nov 17 08:17:07 .:lockywolf:.	maybe
Nov 17 08:17:12 .:lockywolf:.	I don't remember
Nov 17 08:17:30 .:lockywolf:.	I have always thought that all -comm guys are the same thing.

Nov 17 10:21:13 .:lockywolf:.	does it actually intercept all the hardware interactions?
Nov 17 10:21:56 .:olivermead:.	idk, I pretend the ME doesn't exist for peace of mind purposes
Nov 17 10:23:16 .:olivermead:.	supposedly my coreboot installation on the x220 "neutered" the ME but idk what that means either
Nov 17 10:23:19 .:lockywolf:.	well, on RPi4 you cannot  do that
Nov 17 10:23:36 .:lockywolf:.	"neuter" means disabling the ability to breed
Nov 17 10:23:57 .:olivermead:.	I think it was analogy rather than literal
Nov 17 10:23:58 .:lockywolf:.	usually by cutting off something
Nov 17 10:24:11 .:olivermead:.	"The ME can't f* you anymore" might be close
Nov 17 10:24:50 .:lockywolf:.	I should learn some ME
Nov 17 10:26:44 .:parsnip:.	one of the stupid things about "scan the QR code for a menu", is how annoyed the waitstaff get when you ask for a physical menu
Nov 17 10:27:17 .:lockywolf:.	In many places I have been there are not physical menus at all.
Nov 17 10:27:26 .:olivermead:.	gotta start a QR code based malware campaign so people stop using them for silly things like menus
Nov 17 10:27:27 .:lockywolf:.	*no
Nov 17 10:27:40 .:lockywolf:.	will not work, I guarantee
Nov 17 10:27:51 .:olivermead:.	yeh they'll just make you download an app

Nov 17 10:40:28 .:twb:.	olivermead: BTDT
Nov 17 10:40:51 .:olivermead:.	what is this
Nov 17 10:41:09 .:twb:.	I think it's originally from a Pepsi commercial?
Nov 17 10:48:34 .:olivermead:.	that doesn't entirely answer the question but ok
Nov 17 11:10:18 .:parsnip:.	they also seem pretty annoyed if you ask for water with no ice
Nov 17 11:10:34 .:parsnip:.	WHAT IS THIS A WATERING HOLE?!
Nov 17 11:10:54 .:olivermead:.	parsnip: is this a US etiquette thing I don't understand?
Nov 17 11:11:24 .:parsnip:.	how do i determine that?
Nov 17 11:11:40 .:olivermead:.	y'know what, good question
Nov 17 11:12:02 .:parsnip:.	do they provide water when you eat out?
Nov 17 11:12:32 .:parsnip:.	if so, does that water typically have ice?
Nov 17 11:12:48 .:parsnip:.	is there a process for when you finish your water and are hoping for more?
Nov 17 11:13:04 .:olivermead:.	gotta ask normally, very few places I've been have a jug on the table, some will bring a jug if you ask for one, normally you ask for a glass of water and they ask if you want ice and a slice
Nov 17 11:14:11 .:parsnip:.	here they often bring out a platter of glasses of water filled with ice, and topped off with water. some restaurants provide a big thing of water, but that's "unique"
Nov 17 11:14:13 .:twb:.	olivermead: around here it was normal until covid
Nov 17 11:14:41 .:parsnip:.	and the strategy with the ice is that it's too cold to drink, and requires less water to refill
Nov 17 11:14:52 .:olivermead:.	twb: I can understand that
Nov 17 11:15:25 .:parsnip:.	and they'll often make sure to refill the water as they're bringing the bill, because suddenly they're providing service and you should tip
Nov 17 11:15:27 .:twb:.	I mean... it's still common, but less so
Nov 17 11:15:31 .:olivermead:.	parsnip: they're trying to make you drink less water?? surely the water costs them less than the same volume of ice
Nov 17 11:15:46 .:twb:.	parsnip: pfft, tipping.  Fix your hospo labour laws.
Nov 17 11:15:47 .:olivermead:.	than*
Nov 17 11:15:58 .:parsnip:.	costs the waitstaff?
Nov 17 11:16:24 .:parsnip:.	it's the waitstaff working for tips. they do whatever minimizes their physical effort, etc
Nov 17 11:16:59 .:parsnip:.	i mean, i always tip, but i'll avoid going back, or just avoid eating out
Nov 17 11:17:08 .:olivermead:.	ah there's the difference, they're refilling the water glasses whenever. Here it's normally at the same time as other drinks at the table and if there's a big group they will just leave a jug if they can
Nov 17 11:17:47 .:parsnip:.	yeah one in eight restaurants provide carafes of water or w/e
Nov 17 11:22:10 .:twb:.	it would be unusual for them to waste time filling individual glasses here, unless it's a real fancy place
Nov 17 11:22:29 .:twb:.	you know the sort where they make you smell the wine first
Nov 17 11:23:45 .:parsnip:.	how do you politely get out of smelling it?
Nov 17 11:24:14 .:parsnip:.	if you tell them your nose is dripping, they might assume you won't enjoy the wine
Nov 17 11:24:16 .:twb:.	parsnip: you don't buy wine?
Nov 17 11:24:31 .:twb:.	Or better, you don't go to such a restaraunt in the first place
Nov 17 11:25:08 .:parsnip:.	i meant _hypothetically_!
Nov 17 11:25:26 .:parsnip:.	"i can't smell you insensitive clod!"
Nov 17 11:26:00 .:twb:.	I'm hyposmic, not anosmic.
Nov 17 11:27:20 .:parsnip:.	"i don't smell, you smell. i stink"
Nov 17 11:29:19 .:olivermead:.	parsnip: you act like you're smelling it, say "That'll do just fine" in a smug voice, then you carry on with your life
Nov 17 11:30:10 .:twb:.	olivermead: usually you just nod
Nov 17 11:30:56 .:twb:.	I watched a documentary recently that explained the protocol for buying a philly cheesesteak
Nov 17 11:31:00 .:olivermead:.	you don't want to act like you /belong/ in such a fancy place
Nov 17 11:31:37 .:twb:.	olivermead: in that case say "I'll 'ave a pint of corkage, Gunga Din!"
Nov 17 11:57:16 .:twb:.	parsnip: do americans who aren't kooky war nerds know about Kipling?
Nov 17 11:57:37 .:twb:.	parsnip: or is it more like "why are non-white actors playing Mowgli in the remake of disney"
Nov 17 11:58:48 .:twb:.	(I know the war kooks DEFINITELY know about kipling)
Nov 17 12:07:29 .:twb:.	lulz, this random game has "all wars" and the list is mostly normal stuff, but then there's "innsmouth 1928" campaign DLC
Nov 17 12:07:39 .:twb:.	And yeah, that's a fictional war against cultists

Nov 17 12:14:27 .:twb:.	jbe: the actual punchline is "I don't know; I've never kippled."
Nov 17 12:33:57 .:empwilli:.	sooo some time back there was some discussion on here on a programming language context aware search/replace tool; iirc wasamasa wrote about having some helm integration for said tool
Nov 17 12:34:05 .:empwilli:.	has someone an idea what that tool was called?

Nov 17 18:02:04 .:e1f:.	thuna`: yes!
Nov 17 18:02:20 .:thuna`:.	Oh, I read your original message as "they shot at the wrong person"
Nov 17 18:02:23 .:e1f:.	he crossed 2 counties and had ~40 cars in pursuit at the end
Nov 17 18:03:11 .:e1f:.	let me summarize it then, the chase begins at a traffic stop for a stolen honda civic, which is dumped 20 minutes later for a ford econoline van that he hotwires with which he escapes by ramming a cruiser blocking him (in canada, the chase would have ended there), then he dups that, breaks into a family home, steals the keys to their truck and continues the chase for another hour
Nov 17 18:03:52 .:e1f:.	i felt sorry for that family because it looked like that truck was their livelyhood
Nov 17 18:04:09 .:thuna`:.	No, this is actually the same one that I was talking about: https://abc7.com/hacienda-heights-chase-driver-detained-pursuit-crash/12437961/
Nov 17 18:04:31 .:e1f:.	i did notice that during the chase he enjoyed ramming teslas and taking out their mirrors
Nov 17 18:04:46 .:thuna`:.	Could've just left them alone
Nov 17 18:06:21 .:e1f:.	there were two police choppers with nightsuns lighting him up by the end

Nov 17 18:17:51 .:acdw:.	i think
Nov 17 18:17:54 .:oats:.	so I need to feed it and hopefully bake in the next couple days
Nov 17 18:17:58 .:acdw:.	not very tasty tho

Nov 17 18:27:05 .:yates:.	i kinda don't like depending on a package to do this

Nov 17 18:27:23 .:pkal:.	thuna`: It used to be on MELPA, but was removed.  I tried adding to to GNU ELPA, but Drew wasn't too intersted in cooperating

Nov 17 18:30:20 .:thuna`:.	Is there an emacswiki package-archive?

Nov 17 18:31:37 .:thuna`:.	dired+ is on emacsmirror, yeah
Nov 17 18:34:57 .:oats:.	huh, george takei is on mastodon now
Nov 17 18:35:57 .:acdw:.	oh neat

Nov 17 18:37:19 .:acdw:.	i'm on tilde.zone and tiny.tilde.website, but there's emacs.ch for emacslovers
Nov 17 18:37:42 .:oats:.	I've been seeing lots of emacs.ch promotion on the TL :P
Nov 17 18:37:56 .:acdw:.	lol
Nov 17 18:41:57 .:pkal:.	thuna`: I created my own but that might not have been a good idea
Nov 17 18:42:19 .:thuna`:.	pkal: With (hopefully) two people on it, I'm sure it'll work out :)
Nov 17 18:43:28 .:pkal:.	?
Nov 17 18:43:35 .:pkal:.	Why two people?
Nov 17 18:43:36 .:acdw:.	i keep thinking about doing my own personal instance
Nov 17 18:44:24 .:pkal:.	acdw: I've been using https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/, and there also is https://docs.microblog.pub/.  But both are pretty young and buggy
Nov 17 18:45:42 .:thuna`:.	pkal: I don't know how exactly mastodon works but I figured you needed to be "federated" (don't know what it is, exactly) to get your posts seen in other instances, but is that not the case?
Nov 17 18:47:21 .:acdw:.	pkal: i've heard of gotosocial but not microblog .. there's also honk
Nov 17 18:47:22 .:pkal:.	yes, but you can have a single-user instance just like you can have a mail server with only one user
Nov 17 18:47:32 .:acdw:.	but thanks for the info on young and buggy. might wait a bit
Nov 17 18:47:35 .:pkal:.	acdw: Honk might be too radical
Nov 17 18:47:57 .:oats:.	I really want to run my own mastodon instance but it's so large and complex to set up
Nov 17 18:48:01 .:oats:.	I'd be the only user
Nov 17 18:48:15 .:lechner:.	jbe / thanks!
Nov 17 18:48:28 .:thuna`:.	pkal: Oh, so random people can't stumble across your posts, which I guess isn't a negative
Nov 17 18:49:24 .:acdw:.	pkal: radical?
Nov 17 18:50:26 .:pkal:.	thuna`: If anyone from their instance follows me, then I belive it should be listed under the "federated timeline"

Nov 17 18:50:55 .:pkal:.	acdw: AFAIK it doesn't have any like or reblog indications, to avoid gamification
Nov 17 18:51:38 .:pkal:.	jlf: A two-way bridge would be too chaotic (and would probably get banned), but a one-way bridge (ala RSS bots) could be done.

Nov 17 18:52:22 .:pkal:.	acdw: On being buggy:  It does work and is easy to set up, the main issue is that I can't see who people are following or who liked some post

Nov 17 19:39:51 .:parsnip:.	yeah i'm not sure what a jsonprc is
Nov 17 19:40:30 .:olivermead:.	it's a system for remote procedure calls based around the json format

Nov 17 22:19:48 .:wasamasa:.	they want to fix that though
Nov 17 22:20:58 .:olivermead:.	oh melpa is quite literally tracking the master branch commit for commit
Nov 17 22:21:15 .:olivermead:.	even though haskell-mode's own CI is failing
Nov 17 22:23:33 .:bremner:.	that's how melpa rolls

Nov 17 22:23:56 .:rudybot:.	bremner: howdy. what's the state-of-the-art emacs mode for html pages? they're really velocity templates.
Nov 17 22:24:16 .:wasamasa:.	right, the plan is to change the naming to version+number of commits since then
Nov 17 22:24:33 .:bremner:.	if only git-describe existed when they started
Nov 17 22:24:45 .:olivermead:.	bremner: in that case it's a "don't push unstable changes to master" problem
Nov 17 22:25:15 .:bremner:.	olivermead: in which case my answer is F OFF, master is our development branch. We have releases.
Nov 17 22:25:28 .:olivermead:.	and so the cycle continues
Nov 17 22:27:14 .:olivermead:.	I'm not overly bothered, I was just trying to develop in a container over tramp and it wouldn't let me. Emacs is still the best haskell editor because of haskell-mode
Nov 17 22:29:02 .:bremner:.	actually, I think melpa _can_ track branches other than master/main, but someone (TM) has to pay enough attention for that to happen. Which is basically never
Nov 17 22:29:39 .:bpalmer:.	bremner: repositories should probably not assume that git is the only version control tool in existence.
Nov 17 22:29:46 .:bpalmer:.	Why, just this last week a new one was released!
Nov 17 22:30:08 .:bremner:.	bpalmer: melpa supports both gitlab and github
Nov 17 22:30:42 .:bremner:.	ok, but seriously I don't know if git is mandatory
Nov 17 22:31:31 .:hodapp:.	rudybot: MELPA is a contraction for mea culpa (MEa cuLPA).
Nov 17 22:31:31 .:rudybot:.	hodapp: has topic policed in C++, sua culpa.
Nov 17 22:32:39 .:NotThatRPG:.	Quick regexp question -- I'm in lisp-mode, but when I do a regexp match, Emacs is treating the splat (*) as a non-word character. But at least in common lisp, it *is* a word character
Nov 17 22:33:07 .:bremner:.	NotThatRPG: regular expressions are fundamentally not about lisp
Nov 17 22:33:18 .:bremner:.	use something like [\w*] I guess
Nov 17 22:34:27 .:NotThatRPG:.	bremner: I thought that the current syntax table would affect how re-match interprets character classes. Is that not so?
Nov 17 22:34:39 .:bremner:.	I don't think there's a connection
Nov 17 22:34:50 .:thuna`:.	Huh, I thought elpa had an unstable version, but I can't find it now
Nov 17 22:36:35 .:bpalmer:.	yes, the current syntax table does affect the character classes
Nov 17 22:37:28 .:bpalmer:.	perhaps show a test case and verify what the syntax entry for * is (using C-u C-x =  , for example)
Nov 17 22:38:47 .:bpalmer:.	NotThatRPG: I just verified in a common-lisp-mode buffer and * is not a word constituent but a symbol constituent
Nov 17 22:39:39 .:NotThatRPG:.	bremner: Ah. That's helpful!  Unfortunately, I can't use symbol-char as a class in a regexp -- or is there some way to do that?
Nov 17 22:40:38 .:bremner:.	I don't know about that.
Nov 17 22:40:57 .:bpalmer:.	NotThatRPG: ‘\sCODE’ matches any character whose syntax type is CODE
Nov 17 22:41:21 .:bpalmer:.	so, in this case, \s_  matches any symbol constituent
Nov 17 22:41:55 .:bpalmer:.	see (elisp) Syntax Class Table and (elisp) Regexp Backslash
Nov 17 22:45:38 .:NotThatRPG:.	bpalmer: Thanks!
Nov 17 22:46:26 .:bpalmer:.	(oops, to correct myself above, I was in lisp-mode, not common-lisp-mode)
Nov 17 22:46:52 .:bpalmer:.	NotThatRPG: de nada
Nov 17 22:48:28 .:NotThatRPG:.	You don't happen to know if there are equivalents to the word movement commands that operate on symbols instead, do you?
Nov 17 22:48:52 .:bpalmer:.	sure, see forward-symbol
Nov 17 22:50:55 .:bpalmer:.	see also (info "(elisp) Word Motion")   if you want to set up a fancier notion of "word" , too (for example, to redefine it into being identical to symbols)
Nov 17 22:51:02 .:bpalmer:.	this is how subword-mode works
Nov 17 22:51:51 .:bpalmer:.	'Subword mode ... changes the definition of a word so that word-based commands stop inside symbols with mixed uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. "GtkWidget", "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext".'
Nov 17 23:12:18 .:NotThatRPG:.	bpalmer: weirdly, there doesn't seem to be a "backward-symbol" to match forward
Nov 17 23:16:03 .:rpav:.	NotThatRPG: (forward-symbol -1) ;)
Nov 17 23:16:12 .:NotThatRPG:.	rpav: Thanks!!!
Nov 17 23:16:28 .:rpav:.	emacs is not perfectly consistent in its near-perfect inconsistency
Nov 17 23:19:48 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: always forward, never backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling twirling twirling towards freedom!
Nov 17 23:19:49 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: Let's move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling towards freedom.
Nov 17 23:20:37 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: you always know just what to say
Nov 17 23:20:37 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: I do not know. I find it interesting because it made me see that a word always points at another word and that I need a linguistic map to make sense of what someone says. Which reminds me that it is maybe a good idea to say "we call that a tree" as opposed to "that is a tree" but I just cant remember so me too says "that is that".
Nov 17 23:21:10 .:bpalmer:.	look, you do some trig with word2vec and you are good to go.
Nov 17 23:22:01 .:bpalmer:.	rudybot: but I bet you don't even remember the double sine identity
Nov 17 23:22:02 .:rudybot:.	bpalmer: the original (p (sine angle) is a trig identity to find sine, and takes the input and diminishes it until it becomes ..... what ?
Nov 17 23:22:51 .:NotThatRPG:.	OK, I'm obviously doing _something_ wrong, because searching forward for "\\s_" works, but "\\s_+" does not
Nov 17 23:24:15 .:bpalmer:.	NotThatRPG: you probably want "\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+"
Nov 17 23:24:46 .:bpalmer:.	characters can belong to only a single syntax class, and a symbol is made up of both word constituents and symbol constituents.
Nov 17 23:25:25 .:NotThatRPG:.	Aha! Thanks!

Nov 18 12:18:45 .:sandra:.	(straight-use-package 'vertico-prescient) didn't work even though vertico-prescient is on MELPA. https://melpa.org/#/vertico-prescient
Nov 18 12:19:35 .:sandra:.	stefan-_: I have scripts that use git commit -am but I def wanna stick to adding files manually
Nov 18 12:20:03 .:sandra:.	I have a lot of untracked scratch files and loosey-goosey ideas that never went anywhere
Nov 18 12:21:10 .:stefan-_:.	sandra, I use this is for markdown notes mainly, for code this would be a different story
Nov 18 12:24:55 .:parsnip:.	oh shooot, what is equivalent of `export HOME=$(pwd); emacs` in Windowos?
Nov 18 12:25:37 .:olivermead:.	stefan-_: magit is great because you can stage individual hunks
Nov 18 12:26:39 .:Guest12:.	git add -p :)
Nov 18 12:26:47 .:thblt:.	In every context where I git add -a or git commit -am, I somehow generate the message too.
Nov 18 12:27:02 .:olivermead:.	Guest12: interactively though
Nov 18 12:27:53 .:olivermead:.	parsnip: does window$ even have a proper analogue of $HOME? %USERPROFILE% and %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% would be closest
Nov 18 12:27:58 .:thblt:.	Guest12: That would be git add -i
Nov 18 12:28:14 .:sandra:.	olivermead: I love magit, I sometimes wish it had even finer granularity because sometimes hunks get stuck together just for being next to one another
Nov 18 12:28:38 .:parsnip:.	hmm, $env:HOME="." emacs seems to work
Nov 18 12:28:51 .:olivermead:.	sandra: I have noticed this recently, splitting hunks would be top tier
Nov 18 12:29:39 .:olivermead:.	thblt: thank you, this is perfect *time to write a comint git wrapper to replace magit*
Nov 18 12:29:51 .:sandra:.	It would be spacies
Nov 18 12:31:44 .:olivermead:.	sandra: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/6083/magit-split-hunk-into-two-hunks apparently you can apply sections of a displayed hunk
Nov 18 12:31:57 .:stefan-_:.	currently I resolve merge conflicts by editing the files directly, is there some tooling support for this in emacs/magit?
Nov 18 12:32:40 .:olivermead:.	stefan-_: https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Resolving-Conflicts.html suggests Smerge, Ediff and Emerge
Nov 18 12:35:09 .:stefan-_:.	olivermead, thanks for the pointer
Nov 18 12:42:14 .:hans_olo:.	ty thblt :)
Nov 18 12:43:00 .:sandra:.	Now I wanted to change that straight vertico-prescient over to use another repo but I forgot how to reset where straight thinks the recipe is
Nov 18 12:45:25 .:olivermead:.	sandra: like a fork?
Nov 18 12:47:07 .:sandra:.	olivermead: Right, but just setting it to the prescient repo prescient address. (straight-use-package '(vertico-prescient :host github :repo "radian-software/prescient.el"))
Nov 18 12:47:44 .:parsnip:.	seems to install fine here
Nov 18 12:48:49 .:olivermead:.	sandra: installation at that repo suggests that prescient and vertico-prescient are different packagese entirely
Nov 18 12:48:55 .:olivermead:.	*packages
Nov 18 12:49:02 .:parsnip:.	i tried this http://ix.io/4gcC/elisp and $env:HOME="." emacs
Nov 18 12:54:06 .:parsnip:.	sandra: what issue did you actually see?
Nov 18 12:54:33 .:parsnip:.	"seems to not be installed" is often a false assumption in emacs
Nov 18 12:55:40 .:sandra:.	Well, I can't re-see the issue now until I figure out how to get straight to forget about the package so I can start over
Nov 18 12:56:04 .:sandra:.	A huge error message popped up
Nov 18 12:56:57 .:sandra:.	But I can't find it again since I use orderless and can never find the buffers I'm looking for whoch is why I wanted to install prescient in the first place
Nov 18 13:05:34 .:parsnip:.	can test with `export HOME=/tmp/testing; emacs`
Nov 18 13:05:53 .:sandra:.	Ah that's great
Nov 18 13:06:24 .:sandra:.	In a temporary shell session so I don't clobber my normal shell
Nov 18 13:24:29 .:jbe:.	rudybot: I'm as sincere as a youtuber apology
Nov 18 13:24:30 .:rudybot:.	jbe: plz tell me nice pete in the topic is not a youtuber
Nov 18 13:32:25 .:olivermead:.	you've heard of emacs pinky, now get ready for SpacEmacs thumb
Nov 18 13:35:03 .:olivermead:.	I can't for the life of me get yasnippet to expand snippets
Nov 18 13:50:49 .:olivermead:.	nm I got it
Nov 18 13:56:28 .:dminuoso:.	olivermead: Spacemacs was invented by Apple when they invented their new butterfly switches.
Nov 18 13:56:50 .:olivermead:.	to wear out the keyboard faster?
Nov 18 13:56:58 .:dminuoso:.	Dont believe me? I destroyed 2 spacebars already. Covered under warranty luckily, otherwise the repair cost would have been around 600 dollars.
Nov 18 13:57:09 .:dminuoso:.	At that point I decided to go back to thinkpad.
Nov 18 13:57:13 .:dminuoso:.	(600 dollars each!)
Nov 18 13:57:47 .:dminuoso:.	Because it turns out to repair the space bar you have to replace the keyboard, to replace the keyboard, you have to replace the entire upper half of the lower body, you know including the battery, the touchbad, and a bunch of other eletronics...
Nov 18 13:57:56 .:olivermead:.	dminuoso: my x220 keyboard's spacebar is starting to get possibly worn out, cleaning it seemed to help but I may be due to replace it soon, it is original
Nov 18 13:57:59 .:dminuoso:.	All of which is glued together.
Nov 18 13:58:33 .:olivermead:.	the x200 keyboard is a dream to use (refurbished keyboard)
Nov 18 13:58:40 .:dminuoso:.	I had two separate friends shipping their macbook for repair out of warranty, and they paid that price.
Nov 18 13:59:23 .:olivermead:.	every time I think to myself "those m<n> macbooks look nice, maybe I should get one at some point" I remember repair is a thing that I like to do myself
Nov 18 13:59:39 .:olivermead:.	hence my x220 is called narsil
Nov 18 14:01:18 .:dminuoso:.	Well macbooks do have by far the best displays.
Nov 18 14:01:22 .:dminuoso:.	I give them that.
Nov 18 14:02:18 .:olivermead:.	I also like the idea of low power consumption, and shiny
Nov 18 14:02:27 .:olivermead:.	but it isn't worth it
Nov 18 14:02:52 .:olivermead:.	I'm also /very/ used to linux, and Asahi isn't mature yet
Nov 18 14:02:57 .:dminuoso:.	Yeah they do have good power consumption
Nov 18 14:03:06 .:dminuoso:.	And to be fair, apple silicon is just superb
Nov 18 14:03:16 .:olivermead:.	(specifically X11/GNU/SystemD/Linux)
Nov 18 14:03:24 .:dminuoso:.	But not worth being locked into a strange, buddy, constantly lagging behind, and mostly closed operating system
Nov 18 14:03:29 .:dminuoso:.	And I want a tiling window manager.
Nov 18 14:03:46 .:olivermead:.	dwm and stumpwm any day
Nov 18 14:03:56 .:dminuoso:.	(its still mindblowing that apple silicon is faster than x86 even after rosetta on many codes.
Nov 18 14:04:08 .:dminuoso:.	that is compared to modern intel/amd chips
Nov 18 14:04:20 .:olivermead:.	stop it you're making me want one
Nov 18 14:04:57 .:olivermead:.	although I don't care much about speed on a laptop, since I defer anything intensive to my desktop
Nov 18 14:13:54 .:olivermead:.	I've often thought about getting a raspbery pi 400 for general purpose use
Nov 18 14:31:31 .:jbe:.	you can just do like I did and buy one to have lying around unopened
Nov 18 14:31:59 .:olivermead:.	ornamental, good idea
Nov 18 14:32:15 .:olivermead:.	is that the macbook or the pi 400?
Nov 18 14:32:56 .:jbe:.	the latter
Nov 18 14:33:05 .:jbe:.	but I would imagine it'd be the same with a macbook
Nov 18 14:45:16 .:benny:.	I also have a pi 400 lying around, but I recently picked up a 2% used toner printer that has no network access and want to purpose the pi 400 as a printer server ;-)
Nov 18 14:58:45 .:lechner:.	Hi, is there a trick to getting pinentry working in the minibuffer besides 'allow-emacs-pinentry' in gpg-agent.conf plus starting (pinentry-mode)?
Nov 18 15:05:48 .:xaltsc:.	Hey, I'm using Xenops with Org mode and it works fine, however, with my derived mode from org (https://hg.sr.ht/~xaltsc/xettel-mode.el/browse/xettel.el?rev=tip), when rendering latex fragments, I'm getting "Error running timer "funcall": (wrong-type-argument stringp nil)". From what I can tell, there's no significant difference between local variables, any idea how I might debug this ? The debugger,
Nov 18 15:05:50 .:xaltsc:.	with debug-on-error, isn't very helpful here as functions are inline ones it seems.
Nov 18 15:13:03 .:olivermead:.	had to reload emacs to test, but you can use (set 'epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback) to enter gpg passphrase in emacs without using pinentry, it's the trick that DOOM emacs uses
Nov 18 15:16:55 .:danisanti:.	does anyone know how to make Emacs go to the source code of a specific procedure/function at point?
Nov 18 15:17:24 .:danisanti:.	mainly in Lisp, if possible in all types of source code
Nov 18 15:18:40 .:gnoo:.	xref is the general thing o do that
Nov 18 15:18:43 .:gnoo:.	M-.
Nov 18 15:18:57 .:gnoo:.	for elisp, it usually works
Nov 18 15:19:08 .:olivermead:.	danisanti: if you use evil: g d otherwise C-h f RET then navigate to the source link
Nov 18 15:19:16 .:olivermead:.	ooh M-.
Nov 18 15:19:32 .:gnoo:.	for some other things, you can use etags with a TAGS file: etags *.h *.c
Nov 18 15:19:52 .:gnoo:.	some lsp stuff also provides a backend for xref
Nov 18 15:20:32 .:olivermead:.	damn I wish M-. worked in evil by default
Nov 18 15:21:09 .:danisanti:.	evil is not for me. I am good :-P
Nov 18 15:21:20 .:danisanti:.	thanks gnoo
Nov 18 15:22:29 .:danisanti:.	olivermead: never learned evil-mode, never will
Nov 18 15:22:50 .:olivermead:.	well if you didn't come from (neo)vi(m) there's no point
Nov 18 15:23:23 .:danisanti:.	gnoo: when M-. asks for a C source dir what should I do, to configure it to show the C source?
Nov 18 15:23:46 .:gnoo:.	go to the dir containg the src/ folder of emacs's source
Nov 18 15:24:19 .:olivermead:.	git clone --depth 1 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git if you don't already have it
Nov 18 15:24:21 .:danisanti:.	ok, I have to download emacs source then
Nov 18 15:24:29 .:danisanti:.	olivermead: thanks!
Nov 18 15:24:44 .:gnoo:.	only for the functions that are defined in the C source files
Nov 18 15:24:52 .:gnoo:.	for lisps it'll just find the right file automatically
Nov 18 15:25:06 .:danisanti:.	gnoo: yes
Nov 18 15:29:27 .:danisanti:.	when typing M-. and putting the path of emacs src I get this message and I don't know what to answer: The local variables list in ... contains values that may not be safe (*).
Nov 18 15:29:50 .:danisanti:.	I have to answer y, n, !, i
Nov 18 15:30:11 .:danisanti:.	The question is if I want to apply it?
Nov 18 15:30:12 .:olivermead:.	that's the variables in .dir-local.el, whether you trust them or not
Nov 18 15:30:51 .:danisanti:.	olivermead: I have no idea. what trusting them means?
Nov 18 15:31:18 .:olivermead:.	it mostly matters if you're going to be editing and contributing
Nov 18 15:31:29 .:olivermead:.	danisanti: it said the values may not be safe
Nov 18 15:31:51 .:olivermead:.	i.e. a malicious actor could set those to something you dO nOT wANT
Nov 18 15:32:29 .:olivermead:.	but it's the emacs source code, it's probably fine. (read .dir-locals.el if you're not sure)
Nov 18 15:32:41 .:bpalmer:.	danisanti: as a simple example, suppose an attacker set indent-line-function to a function like 'mail-line-to-an-unfriendly-government
Nov 18 15:33:01 .:bpalmer:.	danisanti: you may not *want* to send off an email every time you hit TAB
Nov 18 15:33:16 .:danisanti:.	in the source code? bpalmer
Nov 18 15:33:25 .:danisanti:.	or in my running emacs?
Nov 18 15:33:52 .:bpalmer:.	danisanti: file local variables are general purpose; they can show up in any random file
Nov 18 15:35:15 .:bpalmer:.	danisanti: if there's a directory-local file, or a file variables section inside a file, many variables are either marked as safe (any value is allowed), or are given a validation function so that most values they'll be set to are safe.
Nov 18 15:36:15 .:olivermead:.	the .dir-locals.el should only affect that directory though, right?
Nov 18 15:36:19 .:jonlevin:.	dir-locals can do pretty much anything; however you are already running emacs, which is built from the rest of the contents of that repo, so the question in this case is moot
Nov 18 15:36:33 .:jonlevin:.	and anything below - but they can run code
Nov 18 15:36:33 .:bpalmer:.	Right.
Nov 18 15:36:45 .:olivermead:.	jonlevin: yes, recursive
Nov 18 15:37:32 .:danisanti:.	wow, this is very confusing. I have answered 'n'
Nov 18 15:37:50 .:danisanti:.	thanks
Nov 18 15:37:50 .:jonlevin:.	emacs will ask you that for any dir-locals it encounters for the first time, the "may not be trustworthy" part is generic
Nov 18 15:38:11 .:olivermead:.	danisanti: it's like .vscode in a project
Nov 18 15:38:21 .:jonlevin:.	n is fine :) normally they're used to establish coding conventions such as use of tabs and spaces, indentation and the like
Nov 18 15:38:40 .:jonlevin:.	you can always look inside the file to see what they actually do
Nov 18 15:39:00 .:danisanti:.	thanks all
Nov 18 15:39:39 .:jonlevin:.	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DirectoryVariables
Nov 18 15:40:22 .:danisanti:.	olivermead: vscode is for people uninformed with newer computers. never used vscode, so I don't know what it means
Nov 18 15:41:21 .:olivermead:.	it's project local settings
Nov 18 15:41:32 .:danisanti:.	jonlevin: thanks. that page was much more clearer
Nov 18 15:41:49 .:danisanti:.	olivermead: thanks
Nov 18 15:41:58 .:olivermead:.	(info "(emacs) Directory Variables") if you wish not to leave emacs
Nov 18 15:43:13 .:jonlevin:.	olivermead: I mean, always be infoing, but emacs' own manuals are often an exercise in overly verbose circular references imo, so ymmv ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Nov 18 15:48:14 .:olivermead:.	I tend to read things by skimming first, saves time
Nov 18 15:51:53 .:jonlevin:.	I'm the opposite - if I don't grok something I grind to a halt until I do. Wikipedia is hell. Many years of undiagnosed ADHD I think it why, but now I know I still haven't been able to break that pattern.
Nov 18 15:52:14 .:jonlevin:.	s/it why/is why/
Nov 18 15:54:33 .:jonlevin:.	I think the advent of hypertext has made cross-referencing rather pathological too. Many times I find myself reading a two sentence description of something that adds almost no information over and above the name of the thing, and definitely has no relevance to my initial context.
Nov 18 15:55:18 .:olivermead:.	ah, see I always try to do (read) the least to find what I need, then if that isn't enough go through slowly, jumping around the text still
Nov 18 15:56:01 .:jonlevin:.	that's always my *plan*, I just can't *execute* :)
Nov 18 15:56:30 .:olivermead:.	it becomes a problem when reading prose
Nov 18 15:57:21 .:jonlevin:.	my partner is an incredibly (to me) fast reader of novels
Nov 18 15:57:37 .:jonlevin:.	I was horrified when I discovered she often skips the "boring parts"
Nov 18 15:57:46 .:olivermead:.	/what/
Nov 18 15:57:52 .:jonlevin:.	ikr?
Nov 18 15:58:24 .:olivermead:.	that's where the detail is, the beauty of the author's description of the mundane
Nov 18 15:58:33 .:jonlevin:.	though IIUC, there are quite a lot of literary academics who privately admit to not reading much primary text
Nov 18 15:59:11 .:olivermead:.	ah so they started just reading summaries in school and never stopped
Nov 18 15:59:37 .:jonlevin:.	yeah, and graduated to more nuanced (aka pretentious) analysis as they went
Nov 18 16:11:06 .:taeaad:.	I got disconnected earlier. With regards to --with-x-toolkit=no, it seems like my current Emacs installation did have GTK and X11.
Nov 18 16:12:08 .:taeaad:.	Based on M-x describe-variable and then... eh, what was that variable again? To show how you did ./configure.
Nov 18 16:12:33 .:olivermead:.	`system-configuration-options'
Nov 18 16:13:06 .:taeaad:.	Yes.
Nov 18 16:19:41 .:taeaad:.	https://pastebin.com/raw/xsjpb64y
Nov 18 16:20:01 .:taeaad:.	With those options surely I shouldn't use --with-x-toolkit=no, right?

Nov 20 16:48:03 .:pkal:.	Also, this is unrelated to lexical scoping because you aren't using any lexical closures
Nov 20 16:48:26 .:ville:.	pkal: well only errorer out once i turned on lexical-binding t so what do i know
Nov 20 16:48:50 .:pkal:.	Ah, then I might know what is going on.  I'll check the source to verify
Nov 20 16:49:06 .:pkal:.	(also, you know your indentation and formatting is highly irregualr, right?)
Nov 20 16:49:43 .:ville:.	pkal: oh really!? hah yeah. i am a c++ programmer. only way i can keep track of things
Nov 20 16:50:10 .:pkal:.	ville: This is how I'd have formatted it: https://0x0.st/ol_V.el
Nov 20 16:50:15 .:wasamasa:.	ugly as sin
Nov 20 16:50:25 .:pkal:.	And as assumed, the issue is here: https://github.com/ReanGD/emacs-multi-compile/blob/master/multi-compile.el#L306
Nov 20 16:51:13 .:wasamasa:.	why even use eval-expression
Nov 20 16:51:14 .:wasamasa:.	wow
Nov 20 16:51:20 .:wasamasa:.	that's just wrong
Nov 20 16:51:40 .:ville:.	pkal: yeah can't track anything with that kind of indentation
Nov 20 16:51:40 .:pkal:.	The key in your alist (file-readable-p (concat root_dir "makefile")) is passed and evaluated as an object.  The value root_dir is visible under dynamic scoping, not under lexical scoping.
Nov 20 16:52:16 .:wasamasa:.	correct
Nov 20 16:52:16 .:ville:.	so how do i evaluate it right then and there? i tried sticking (eval-expression ...) on it but didn't seem to change
Nov 20 16:52:24 .:pkal:.	ville: eh, it is a minor adjustment and Emacs makes it more natural.
Nov 20 16:52:36 .:wasamasa:.	root_dir would only keep it around if there were a closure involved
Nov 20 16:52:38 .:wasamasa:.	which it's not
Nov 20 16:52:55 .:pkal:.	ville: what I would do, is make use of the symbolp case and pass a symbol that is always true: t
Nov 20 16:53:20 .:pkal:.	ie. set multi-compile-alist to `((,(file-readable-p (concat root_dir "makefile")) ...))
Nov 20 16:53:26 .:wasamasa:.	it would make more sense for that package to allow functions
Nov 20 16:53:38 .:wasamasa:.	these functions could close over variables
Nov 20 16:53:48 .:pkal:.	wasamasa: I agree, but the code looks old
Nov 20 16:54:10 .:wasamasa:.	not exactly much code to fork
Nov 20 16:54:21 .:pkal:.	wait, my suggestion earlier on won't work.  Here is another hack, pass a regulra experssion that will always match: "" (the empty string)
Nov 20 16:54:32 .:pkal:.	ie. set multi-compile-alist to `((,(and (file-readable-p (concat root_dir "makefile")) "") ...))
Nov 20 16:54:43 .:wasamasa:.	why not set it to a function call?
Nov 20 16:54:43 .:pkal:.	but at this point you are really fighting against bad design
Nov 20 16:54:54 .:wasamasa:.	which points to a function working correctly with lexical binding
Nov 20 16:55:09 .:wasamasa:.	rather than putting all the binding stuff in the template
Nov 20 16:55:10 .:pkal:.	set what?
Nov 20 16:55:21 .:pkal:.	oh, you are talking about the general design?
Nov 20 16:55:35 .:ville:.	pkal: well i wouldn't know good or bad elisp if my life depedend on it
Nov 20 16:55:39 .:wasamasa:.	(setq multi-compile-alist '((ville/figure-out-stuff ...)))
Nov 20 16:55:51 .:wasamasa:.	and earlier (defun ville/figure-out-stuff ...)
Nov 20 16:56:23 .:wasamasa:.	then the eval bit would work and the actual work is done by the helper function
Nov 20 16:56:39 .:wasamasa:.	ancient CS adage: every problem can be solved by adding an extra level of indirection
Nov 20 16:56:48 .:pkal:.	what would be caught by the symbolp case, and it would check if *shudders* ville/figure-out-stuff is eq to the value in major-mode
Nov 20 16:56:58 .:wasamasa:.	so add extra parens
Nov 20 16:57:06 .:pkal:.	yes
Nov 20 16:57:37 .:wasamasa:.	obviously untested code :P
Nov 20 16:57:54 .:pkal:.	ville: like with all programming languages, good style is that that makes your life easier in the long term
Nov 20 16:58:23 .:wasamasa:.	ville: it is very easy, dashes instead of underscores, all adjacent closing parens smushed together
Nov 20 16:58:30 .:pkal:.	wasamasa: I am not sure if this will work, because ville/figure-out-stuff requires the value in root_dir to compute the value.
Nov 20 17:00:15 .:pkal:.	ville: Can you try this out: https://0x0.st/ol_6.el
Nov 20 17:00:54 .:ville:.	pkal: sure. i was trying to get it to work on my own, made some progres and got a different looking backtrace for root_dir being void
Nov 20 17:02:28 .:ville:.	"byte-code: Defining as dynamic an already lexical var" but who knows maybe that's from somewhere else in my init.el
Nov 20 17:04:33 .:olivermead:.	dadinn: any luck with `tramp-debug-to-file' ?
Nov 20 17:05:08 .:pkal:.	ville: who gave you that warning?
Nov 20 17:05:33 .:ville:.	pkal: no clue. it just popped in *Messages* once i tried to run my keybind
Nov 20 17:06:16 .:ville:.	but i got it to work using my old function with changes. needed to prefix all the occurances of root_dir as well as do the `((,and...)
Nov 20 17:07:06 .:ville:.	https://bpa.st/UH2A worked apparently
Nov 20 17:07:56 .:pkal:.	hmm, ok so for some reason the package wants `multi-compile-alist' to be set globally, not and not bound?
Nov 20 17:10:04 .:pkal:.	on the formatting thing from before, C is usually formatted the way it is because editors like vi are line oriented.  You delete a block by deleting all the lines containing the block.  But with Lisp and Emacs, you have structural editing commands such as C-M-k to delete an expression, no matter the what else is in a line.  That is why Lispers tend to just gather all the closing parentheses on one line, instead of w
Nov 20 17:10:04 .:pkal:.	riting them all seperatly, which is more fragile when editing structurally.
Nov 20 17:10:43 .:ville:.	your structured editing is fragile if it blows up because of whitespace
Nov 20 17:12:27 .:wasamasa:.	the whitespace is plain unnecessary when performing structured editing
Nov 20 17:14:31 .:pkal:.	ville: you are manipulating the structure, not the whitespace.
Nov 20 17:15:01 .:cow_2001:.	FOUND A BUG!
Nov 20 17:15:07 .:cow_2001:.	i think
Nov 20 17:15:10 .:ville:.	your sentence reads that whitespace makes strucutred editing  more fragile somehow. if it does your structured editing is buggy
Nov 20 17:15:32 .:pkal:.	ville: no, structural editing will just break manual indentation, but the code remains the same
Nov 20 17:15:44 .:pkal:.	cow_2001: will you report it?
Nov 20 17:16:19 .:cow_2001:.	oh, it's probably not a bug. sorry for the alarm. i suspected it to be a typo but it isn't.
Nov 20 17:16:53 .:cow_2001:.	alas.
Nov 20 17:18:03 .:pkal:.	what was it?
Nov 20 17:18:27 .:dadinn:.	olivermead: unfortunately I only have emacs 27.2
Nov 20 17:22:45 .:dadinn:.	pkal: I use straight, so I assume I should be able to get tramp from a git repository, but it doesn't seem to be available :/
Nov 20 17:23:34 .:ville:.	pkal: thanks for the help
Nov 20 17:24:31 .:thuna`:.	What do you make with tofu anyway?
Nov 20 17:24:36 .:grym:.	isn't tramp just in core
Nov 20 17:24:40 .:grym:.	thuna`: ma po tofu
Nov 20 17:24:58 .:grym:.	miso soup
Nov 20 17:25:33 .:dadinn:.	grym: I need newer version than what's in 27.2, so I have access to the tramp-debug-to-file variable

Nov 20 17:27:04 .:quiliro:.	tofu is used to cook anything instead of using meat
Nov 20 17:28:40 .:quiliro:.	it is a vegan replacement, just like free software is a replacement for user-subjugating software
Nov 20 17:28:47 .:pkal:.	vifon: np
Nov 20 17:29:40 .:quiliro:.	tofu is rather a meat replacement for vegans
Nov 20 17:29:53 .:quiliro:.	but it is a poor replacement in the flavour sense
Nov 20 17:29:56 .:grym:.	there are a wide variety of tofu-first dishes; all of which are tastier than retconned ersatz-meat uses
Nov 20 17:29:59 .:quiliro:.	it is not the same
Nov 20 17:30:09 .:quiliro:.	yes!
Nov 20 17:30:25 .:quiliro:.	but don't know about them
Nov 20 17:30:29 .:wasamasa:.	tofu as a scrambled egg replacement is great
Nov 20 17:30:29 .:grym:.	well, now you know two
Nov 20 17:30:47 .:wasamasa:.	tofu as a steak replacement sucks
Nov 20 17:31:04 .:quiliro:.	yes, wasamasa
Nov 20 17:31:09 .:grym:.	amusingly mapo tofu is very much not vegetarian
Nov 20 17:31:12 .:quiliro:.	which two, grym
Nov 20 17:31:20 .:quiliro:.	?
Nov 20 17:31:23 .:grym:.	quiliro: the two i just typed
Nov 20 17:31:34 .:thuna`:.	quiliro: ma po tofu and miso soup, probably
Nov 20 17:32:03 .:wasamasa:.	there's a bunch of other dishes where having something really soft to chew on is good
Nov 20 17:32:13 .:quiliro:.	so I cannot use one of them
Nov 20 17:32:16 .:wasamasa:.	it works well in miso soup for example
Nov 20 17:32:18 .:hlz:.	tofu itself is bland, but it absorbs flavors really well. there's lots of different ways to make tofu dishes. typically the "vegan" way of making tofu is pretty limited.
Nov 20 17:32:44 .:quiliro:.	never heard of miso
Nov 20 17:32:52 .:wasamasa:.	it's breakfast in Japan
Nov 20 17:32:52 .:grym:.	s/of making tofu is//
Nov 20 17:32:58 .:quiliro:.	but mapo is out of the question
Nov 20 17:33:00 .:quiliro:.	for me
Nov 20 17:33:03 .:wasamasa:.	you should try it one day
Nov 20 17:33:09 .:wasamasa:.	well, maybe not for breakfast
Nov 20 17:33:11 .:grym:.	miso is fermented soybean paste
Nov 20 17:33:16 .:wasamasa:.	just as an appetizer
Nov 20 17:33:32 .:hlz:.	thuna`: mapo tofu is great :)
Nov 20 17:33:41 .:wasamasa:.	eating it for breakfast seems pretty hardcore to me
Nov 20 17:34:04 .:grym:.	make a broth base with it and some dried fish bits, add diced tofu and seaweed, tada
Nov 20 17:34:08 .:thuna`:.	I am missing a lot of the ingredients for mapo tofu, so the tofu is going to be sitting in the fridge for a while
Nov 20 17:34:42 .:quiliro:.	grym: if it uses fish, I will not eat it
Nov 20 17:34:48 .:grym:.	ok
Nov 20 17:34:59 .:grym:.	so don't eat japanese food, got it
Nov 20 17:35:07 .:wgreenhouse:.	thuna`: it's pretty tolerant really
Nov 20 17:35:09 .:quiliro:.	probably
Nov 20 17:35:30 .:quiliro:.	I am not japanese, not accustomed to it
Nov 20 17:35:42 .:grym:.	weird flex, but ok
Nov 20 17:36:11 .:quiliro:.	possibly there are very little vegan in Japan if most foods are fish-based
Nov 20 17:36:23 .:grym:.	japan doesn't really understand vegan, no
Nov 20 17:36:25 .:wasamasa:.	I've heard HK cuisine is having fish soup for breakfast
Nov 20 17:36:42 .:quiliro:.	coastal regions in my country have a fish-based diet also
Nov 20 17:36:44 .:grym:.	if you say "give me what the buddhist priests eat", you'll probably wind up with something that might comply with your ruleset
Nov 20 17:36:47 .:hlz:.	not sure about fish soup, but they do eat a lot of fish in hong kong.
Nov 20 17:36:50 .:thuna`:.	I wish the recipes online showed only what was necessary
Nov 20 17:36:53 .:grym:.	... unless you are also GF, in which case RIP
Nov 20 17:37:11 .:grym:.	because seitan is very commonly used as a substitute protein
Nov 20 17:37:46 .:wgreenhouse:.	wasamasa: HK also has a lot of really over the top versions of Western dishes
Nov 20 17:37:52 .:wasamasa:.	lol
Nov 20 17:38:05 .:grym:.	wgreenhouse: we have korean/mexican fusion near us :D
Nov 20 17:38:11 .:grym:.	that's pretty amusing
Nov 20 17:38:24 .:quiliro:.	the enly thing I have heard about japanese is their fishing for shark fins on my country's ocean wildlife reserve

Nov 20 17:39:05 .:wgreenhouse:.	wasamasa: things like "well-done steak with spaghetti"
Nov 20 17:39:09 .:wasamasa:.	lol
Nov 20 17:39:19 .:wasamasa:.	I thought it's gonna be cooking dishes the way westerners expect them to be
Nov 20 17:39:37 .:wasamasa:.	because they wouldn't be able to appreciate what's actually eaten there
Nov 20 17:39:51 .:wgreenhouse:.	more like how Cantonese people of 60 years ago imagined western food to be
Nov 20 17:39:58 .:grym:.	quiliro: pilot whales, too
Nov 20 17:40:01 .:wgreenhouse:.	taken in a whole weird direction over time
Nov 20 17:40:05 .:wasamasa:.	so the other way around, I see

Nov 20 17:42:42 .:olivermead:.	woah
Nov 20 17:44:36 .:quiliro:.	I guess that it is weird to cling to the dead as if they were living inside their tombs ... but it is weirder to think that they live in the sky
Nov 20 17:44:39 .:grym:.	oh fun japanese food fact related to that; curry rice is "western"
Nov 20 17:45:10 .:quiliro:.	I used to use curry on chicken
Nov 20 17:45:12 .:wgreenhouse:.	grym: yes because it's a riff on Anglo-Indian curries
Nov 20 17:45:15 .:grym:.	because curry was introduced in japan by the british, who had already adapted it from indian quisine

Nov 30 05:04:05 .:holomorph:.	tree-sitter made it into emacs? waow
Nov 30 05:05:33 .:spikemaster:.	the "x" needs to be quoted becuase macros are immediately Eval'd after the expansion. without the quote it was expanding to a literal inteiger, so that dynmaic variable shadowing wasn't working
Nov 30 05:06:52 .:bpalmer:.	oh, I think that was perhaps for yan3k , searching backscroll
Nov 30 05:07:34 .:spikemaster:.	i quit the chat and lost the history :(
Nov 30 05:08:35 .:bpalmer:.	but what you're writing isn't quite true. macroexpansion occurs and is a distinct phase from evaluating its result; but the expansion involves interpreting the macro code.
Nov 30 05:09:57 .:bpalmer:.	(defmacro foo () (let ((s 0)) (dotimes (i 10) (setq s (+ s i))) s)) ; (macroexpand '(foo)) => 45
Nov 30 05:11:10 .:bpalmer:.	So the difference between that and what you said is the evaluation *after* or the evaluation *during* the expansion

Dec 07 05:19:47 .:mictty:.	move on
Dec 07 05:28:16 .:lockywolf:.	Is it possible to make flycheck not create bogus .plist files all over the filesystem?
Dec 07 05:29:30 .:mictty:.	i don't flycheck. but many senpais here. so please be patient
Dec 07 05:32:17 .:quiliro:.	I got lost with keyboard-translate-table.
Dec 07 05:33:11 .:quiliro:.	It's value is null.  So I don't understand what was proposed for me to investigate it regarding M-DEL and which keys it is bound to.
Dec 07 05:33:53 .:quiliro:.	s/It's/Its/
Dec 07 05:34:37 .:quiliro:.	If backward-kill-word is binded to both <M-backspace> and <M-delete>, why does the help not mention them both? It only mentions "It is bound to <C-backspace>, M-DEL."
Dec 07 05:34:51 .:quiliro:.	That last remark is what I posted.
Dec 07 05:35:08 .:quiliro:.	when that variable was suggested
Dec 07 06:03:15 .:edgar-rft:.	rudybot: backward-kill-word means you need to turn around and press the key behind your back!
Dec 07 06:03:15 .:rudybot:.	edgar-rft: you can turn "bla" into "bia" from behind with "select-thing-backward" + "wrap", definethat as macro and bind on a key
Dec 07 06:08:27 .:quiliro:.	hey FlowyCoder ... thanks for organizing EmacsConf

Dec 07 23:43:43 .:parsnip:.	*defaults
Dec 07 23:43:44 .:corwin:.	parsnip: I'm not going to dig though devel just now but look at the recent threads talking about merging it in. Messages from jwiegley specifically OFC
Dec 07 23:43:53 .:corwin:.	specifically, even
Dec 07 23:44:03 .:parsnip:.	ah
Dec 07 23:44:10 .:parsnip:.	okay, that sort of makes sense actually
Dec 07 23:44:29 .:parsnip:.	here's my settings, but i don't want to write with-eval-after-load
Dec 07 23:45:13 .:parsnip:.	anyone tried tree sitter on emacs-29?
Dec 07 23:45:21 .:corwin:.	yeah, I guess.  and then dealing with all the edge cases that come up around that.  Make sure this isn't lazy-loaded right before lazy load that, and such
Dec 07 23:45:25 .:parsnip:.	you followed this? https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide?h=feature/tree-sitter
Dec 07 23:45:42 .:corwin:.	I read it, not sure I followed :P
Dec 07 23:45:49 .:acdw:.	parsnip: yeah
Dec 07 23:46:10 .:parsnip:.	did you use the relative directory build-modules? or git clone the separate repo?
Dec 07 23:46:16 .:parsnip:.	going to try the relative first, i guess
Dec 07 23:47:06 .:parsnip:.	seems to check out
Dec 07 23:48:14 .:parsnip:.	hmm, was i supposed to build that before `make install`?
Dec 07 23:48:38 .:parsnip:.	hmm, readme says
Dec 07 23:48:41 .:grym:.	parsnip: https://emacs.grym.io/#org9c7adb4  is most of it, but i copypasted 99% of it from the gitshubs of the various projects there
Dec 07 23:49:19 .:parsnip:.	wtf, your emacs config is a mkdoc?
Dec 07 23:49:43 .:parsnip:.	what a tangled web we weave
Dec 07 23:50:06 .:parsnip:.	emacs-nougat
Dec 07 23:50:49 .:parsnip:.	that author had like a sysadmin ui thing in emacs?
Dec 07 23:51:07 .:acdw:.	i'm gonna make my emacs config a shell script that builds the init into a long command line
Dec 07 23:51:34 .:grym:.	acdw: yess, gremlin mode
Dec 07 23:51:45 .:acdw:.	lol
Dec 07 23:51:52 .:grym:.	copious use of \ at eol
Dec 07 23:55:17 .:grym:.	parsnip: i got it off l d l e w o r k some years ago; it has metastasized somewhat since
Dec 07 23:55:57 .:grym:.	like everything else, it's a shambles
Dec 07 23:56:33 .:grym:.	hmm, should add those circadian fixes acdw was on about
Dec 07 23:58:56 .:parsnip:.	here is js-json-mode next to json-ts-mode: https://ibb.co/ySCBQZQ
Dec 08 00:00:04 .:parsnip:.	so that's amusing, it highlights keys as variable declarations
Dec 08 00:03:58 .:acdw:.	grym: yeah u should lol
Dec 08 00:04:03 .:acdw:.	i just did a whole new file

Dec 08 00:05:51 .:acdw:.	https://ttm.sh/0rQ.txt <- here's dawn, grym
Dec 08 00:12:05 .:grym:.	hmm. eglot doesn't know about projectile, but i'd like to close associated eglot language servers when i close a projectile project...
Dec 08 00:12:38 .:grym:.	acdw: https://github.com/guidoschmidt/circadian.el/issues/27  ahahahahaha
Dec 08 00:14:52 .:thuna`:.	How do you get the built-in treesit to work?
Dec 08 00:15:10 .:spikemaster:.	katodna_cijev: For a 1 million line project you might want to checkout citre. Uses old school ctags to power some fancy completion and jumps.
Dec 08 00:15:32 .:rpav:.	clangd is definitely fine with a million lines
Dec 08 00:15:38 .:rpav:.	or 10 million
Dec 08 00:16:04 .:rpav:.	assuming it's not all in one file, in which case emacs is likely to have other problems ;)
Dec 08 00:16:14 .:bpalmer:.	Aurora_v_kosmose: note that shift-JIS encoding is very popular in Japan, so I suspect that's responsible for your issue
Dec 08 00:16:29 .:rpav:.	grym: yeah annoyingly it uses project.el
Dec 08 00:16:56 .:bpalmer:.	Aurora_v_kosmose: thankfully there are converters so you can rename the files if you decode in shift-jis and encode to utf-8 (probably python3 can handle it)
Dec 08 00:18:12 .:Catie:.	iconv is pretty common for that, and can't Emacs also do it?
Dec 08 00:18:14 .:acdw:.	omg wow grym
Dec 08 00:20:34 .:bpalmer:.	Catie: the issue is the filename , not the contents of the file
Dec 08 00:20:41 .:Catie:.	bpalmer: Shucks, my bad
Dec 08 00:21:03 .:bpalmer:.	I mean, in theory any of these tools do, but I get a headache just thinking about non-programmatic renaming while manipulating coding systems in emacs
Dec 08 00:22:07 .:bpalmer:.	doing something like files = glob.glob('badfile*'); for f in files: s = f.decode('shift-jis').encode('utf-8') ; os.rename(f, s)     just seems conceptually easier.
Dec 08 00:22:22 .:Aurora_v_kosmose:.	I'll just cope with knowing *why* it's behaving weirdly and manually toggle utf-8-unix decoding when needed.
Dec 08 00:23:12 .:bpalmer:.	oops, glob returns strings
Dec 08 00:23:54 .:grym:.	thuna`: https://olddeuteronomy.github.io/post/a-tree-sitter-config-that-works/
Dec 08 00:26:43 .:thuna`:.	grym: That's tree-sitter though, is it not? The built-in tree-sitter is called treesit as I understand
Dec 08 00:26:54 .:parsnip:.	thuna`: ./configure --with-tree-sitter, then add the shared libraries for languages as it specifies, then tell emacs where those are with an elisp variable
Dec 08 00:27:28 .:grym:.	thuna`: oh, yes
Dec 08 00:27:29 .:grym:.	whoops
Dec 08 00:27:49 .:parsnip:.	thuna`: ./admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide
Dec 08 00:28:26 .:parsnip:.	see mention of treesit-extra-load-path
Dec 08 00:29:06 .:thuna`:.	parsnip: (treesit-available-p) is t so it should be alright, but treesit-load-suffixes (which (info "(elisp) Language Definitions") mentions) isn't a thing for me
Dec 08 00:29:32 .:parsnip:.	thuna`: try M-x json-ts-mode
Dec 08 00:30:00 .:thuna`:.	"language definition for json is unavailable"
Dec 08 00:30:19 .:parsnip:.	so you need to follow the guide i pointed to
Dec 08 00:30:26 .:parsnip:.	https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zbpa42/how_to_use_emacs_29_treesitter/
Dec 08 00:31:50 .:parsnip:.	do `./build.sh json`, then set treesit-extra-load-path to '("/path/to/dist/")
Dec 08 00:32:00 .:parsnip:.	or similar
Dec 08 00:32:08 .:parsnip:.	that's what i did
Dec 08 00:36:34 .:johnjaye:.	hmm maybe we should give up and just implement emacs in javascript
Dec 08 00:36:51 .:johnjaye:.	i mean that's what everyone does. react. angular. it's the future (TM)
Dec 08 00:37:18 .:quiliro:.	Saluton!
Dec 08 00:37:48 .:quiliro:.	How can I do version control with git with vanilla emacs?
Dec 08 00:38:37 .:rpav:.	is git support built into vc-mode stuff?
Dec 08 00:38:42 .:rpav:.	if not probably you can't
Dec 08 00:40:43 .:grym:.	i think vc-mode supports git
Dec 08 00:40:47 .:fourfy:.	VC supports git. Command-line git also works through the usual methods.
Dec 08 00:44:38 .:fourfy:.	Actually command line git is a really bad idea for anything interactive
Dec 08 00:44:50 .:rpav:.	M-x eshell ;)
Dec 08 00:44:57 .:wgreenhouse:.	yes, vc-mode does support git, and is still adding features, even if less comprehensive than magit
Dec 08 00:45:34 .:wgreenhouse:.	it also works alongside magit; those `Git-branch` indicators you might have seen in a modeline are generated by vc's minor mode
Dec 08 00:45:37 .:rpav:.	i'd use command-line git before bothering to figure out vc-mode .. my only use for git would be getting emacs that ran magit
Dec 08 00:45:50 .:spikemaster:.	(git command line) + (pipe | outouput to tig) = interactivy
Dec 08 00:49:36 .:_73:.	johnjaye: RMS made his dislike of javascript quite clear over the weekend at EmacsConf.
Dec 08 00:49:51 .:johnjaye:.	emacsconf just happened? T_T
Dec 08 00:50:02 .:thuna`:.	last weekend :/
Dec 08 00:50:18 .:johnjaye:.	well i guess i missed it. i will never know what you look like in person
Dec 08 00:50:23 .:johnjaye:.	anyway
Dec 08 00:51:03 .:johnjaye:.	someone was posting in a mailing group I follow about a logic system, and their post was about designing a javascript "stream-based parser". so i was thinking about JS again
Dec 08 00:53:35 .:thuna`:.	Alright, got c-ts-mode working, when does the magic begin?
Dec 08 00:54:01 .:parsnip:.	thuna`: do a side by side comparison. like, copy the file to a second version
Dec 08 00:54:23 .:thuna`:.	parsnip: Like, one c-mode buffer and one c-ts-mode buffer?
Dec 08 00:57:45 .:thuna`:.	I was mostly referring to the stuff that was done in the emacsconf talk. I can't find the entry points for any of them
Dec 08 01:03:12 .:parsnip:.	i don't know, i'm just waiting for tree-sitter to replace dart-mode
Dec 08 01:05:20 .:parsnip:.	json should have indent 4?
Dec 08 01:06:16 .:parsnip:.	oh nice, it highlights trailing commads
Dec 08 01:06:18 .:parsnip:.	commas
Dec 08 01:06:34 .:parsnip:.	with font-lock-warning-face
Dec 08 01:06:35 .:bpalmer:.	tree-sitter replaces individual modes?
Dec 08 01:06:45 .:parsnip:.	yes
Dec 08 01:06:50 .:cvandusen:.	It does??
Dec 08 01:06:51 .:fsbot:.	Yes!
Dec 08 01:06:52 .:thuna`:.	Is there a simple way to get eglot to understand *-ts-mode's?
Dec 08 01:06:55 .:cvandusen:.	I think not.
Dec 08 01:06:56 .:parsnip:.	there are tree sitter major modes
Dec 08 01:07:37 .:parsnip:.	i imagine you can use tree sitter _beside_ old major modes
Dec 08 01:07:46 .:parsnip:.	but it also provides major modes
Dec 08 01:07:56 »»	bpalmer assumes rms is a typescript fan
Dec 08 01:08:32 .:cvandusen:.	He did make a comment about it a few weeks ago.
Dec 08 01:08:35 .:bpalmer:.	but perhaps dart on the web will revolutionize it all
Dec 08 01:08:45 .:parsnip:.	,shoot bpalmer
Dec 08 01:08:45 »»	fsbot loads its OED and pedantically defines the heck out of bpalmer
Dec 08 01:08:50 .:bpalmer:.	once rms starts writing angular ...
Dec 08 01:09:48 .:parsnip:.	json-ts-mode.el: http://ix.io/4i0U/elisp
Dec 08 01:11:20 .:parsnip:.	wow, these major mode files are refreshingly short
Dec 08 01:11:33 .:bpalmer:.	ugh, the first docstring already is annoying me
Dec 08 01:11:44 .:parsnip:.	c-ts-mode: http://ix.io/4i0V/elisp
Dec 08 01:12:14 .:parsnip:.	bpalmer: why oh why
Dec 08 01:12:22 .:parsnip:.	whyfore art thou?
Dec 08 01:12:42 .:thuna`:.	Are there any open bug reports about eglot/*-ts-mode integration in debbugs? I can't open it for some reason
Dec 08 01:13:16 .:parsnip:.	thuna`: does M-x eglot-ensure error?
Dec 08 01:13:19 .:bpalmer:.	"Number of spaces for each indentation step" <-- do I have any confidence that this will respect indent-tabs-mode ?
Dec 08 01:13:30 .:thuna`:.	parsnip: eglot-ensure isn't a command
Dec 08 01:13:38 .:thuna`:.	But yes, it does error
Dec 08 01:13:54 .:parsnip:.	er, M-x eglot
Dec 08 01:13:58 .:thuna`:.	Same
Dec 08 01:14:23 .:parsnip:.	maybe add a line to eglot-server-programs?
Dec 08 01:14:31 .:parsnip:.	like (c-ts-mode . ???)
Dec 08 01:14:35 .:thuna`:.	For every *ts-mode
Dec 08 01:14:36 .:thuna`:.	?
Dec 08 01:14:56 .:parsnip:.	well, for science
Dec 08 01:15:01 .:thuna`:.	Let me see
Dec 08 01:15:04 .:parsnip:.	you sure do ask a lot of questions
Dec 08 01:15:13 .:thuna`:.	It's my specialty
Dec 08 01:15:21 .:bpalmer:.	these short modes ... does that mean to customize it, you have to go edit treesit.c ?
Dec 08 01:15:52 .:parsnip:.	bpalmer: i doubt it. i expect treesit.c hands off the entire partial tree
Dec 08 01:16:00 .:bpalmer:.	Hmm. OK.
Dec 08 01:16:27 .:parsnip:.	and someone knew how to write these modes concisely
Dec 08 01:16:33 .:bpalmer:.	At any rate, my 2 minute look. May investigate treesitter some day.
Dec 08 01:16:47 .:thuna`:.	Adding c-ts-mode to (c++-mode c-mode) in eglot-server-programs works
Dec 08 01:16:51 .:parsnip:.	yay!
Dec 08 01:17:11 .:thuna`:.	Is there a bug report about it yet?
Dec 08 01:17:16 .:parsnip:.	idk
Dec 08 01:17:39 .:thuna`:.	...Well, could someone check?
Dec 08 01:17:46 .:parsnip:.	i'm relieved that edit worked though
Dec 08 01:17:59 .:parsnip:.	yes. _someone_ _could_
Dec 08 01:18:06 .:parsnip:.	why not you?
Dec 08 01:18:21 .:thuna`:.	22:42 <thuna`> Are there any open bug reports about eglot/*-ts-mode integration in debbugs? I can't open it for some reason
Dec 08 01:18:35 .:thuna`:.	Oh, bash-ts-mode is in there
Dec 08 01:18:56 .:thuna`:.	Sigh, my emacs is just outdated. --sync it is
Dec 08 01:19:09 .:parsnip:.	--sync? how do you get emacs?
Dec 08 01:19:41 .:thuna`:.	emerge. Not sync though, since it's a live ebuild.
Dec 08 01:20:37 .:parsnip:.	i'd mostly like to know when use-package will be merged into emacs-29
Dec 08 01:20:52 .:thuna`:.	It's not in yet?
Dec 08 01:20:54 .:parsnip:.	oh that's right, i've temporarily installed use-package anyways
Dec 08 01:21:04 .:parsnip:.	no
Dec 08 01:21:29 .:parsnip:.	i don't know, is it?
Dec 08 01:22:14 .:parsnip:.	bpalmer: maybe they deliberately left indentation as a problem to solve later
Dec 08 01:23:23 .:parsnip:.	bpalmer: it will use tabs when appropriate
Dec 08 01:23:34 .:parsnip:.	so if i set indent offset to 8, i see a tab char
Dec 08 01:25:08 .:parsnip:.	i'm really loving that warning face for trailing comma in json
Dec 08 01:25:15 .:corwin:.	I don't see it being adding to the emacs-29 branch yet looking at commit messages; the feature/use-package branch is still there.  I see SK working on bugs on the GH side, so I think we are still working through the remaining corner-cases.
Dec 08 01:26:43 .:corwin:.	last commit to feature/use-package is like 5 days ago; here's the last thing I found searching around in emails: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/710#issuecomment-1336203719

Dec 08 17:45:54 .:roadie:.	and btw - after rebooting it no longer complains about locale - the umlauts issue was there from the beginning and its only in summary lines not in the email content I get. I think
Dec 08 17:47:58 .:roadie:.	yes, only in the listing which shows the first 2 sentences of the mail the umlaut is substituted - in the mail itself that character is correct.
Dec 08 17:52:12 .:twb:.	roadie: that's quoted-printable encodig
Dec 08 17:52:23 .:twb:.	roadie: your mail client is failing to correctly decode the email
Dec 08 17:53:06 .:twb:.	roadie: you said "summary lines" – I don't know what that is.  Anywhere in the message body, it should decode that.  If you mean the Subject header field, that has a completely different encoding
Dec 08 17:56:32 .:roadie:.	the subject header field and the email body decode the german umlauts properly. It is just the 'list' view where subject<< first paragraphs - it fails in the first paragraph part

Dec 08 18:23:02 .:amartinez:.	anyone know how one might upgrade the python.el that ships w/ 26.3 so match/case (PEP634) keywords work?
Dec 08 18:24:51 .:w0rm:.	amartinez: suggestions I've seen was basically - copy/load a newer python.el to override the one from your emacs install
Dec 08 18:24:53 .:corwin:.	I have no idea if/how python-mode is maintained but you could look at the version on MELPA or quite likely grab the .el from master and see if it "just works"
Dec 08 18:25:08 .:amartinez:.	that was my fear
Dec 08 18:25:40 .:amartinez:.	I tried to install python 0.28 from the gnu archive (0.25.2 is builtin for my version)
Dec 08 18:26:00 .:corwin:.	FTR, I probably wouldn't overwrite the existing file so much as add a "site-lisp" directory at the start of my load-path and put my "custom" foo.el there
Dec 08 18:26:08 .:amartinez:.	compile threw exceptions on install, and then nothing worked so I had to clean that up.
Dec 08 18:27:16 .:amartinez:.	I guess I could just Rewrite It In Rust™
Dec 08 18:27:21 .:w0rm:.	amartinez: there was a compile?
Dec 08 18:27:41 .:amartinez:.	w0rm: it byte compiled I believe
Dec 08 18:27:54 .:w0rm:.	ah
Dec 08 18:28:00 .:amartinez:.	some method expected N args, got M where N != M
Dec 08 18:30:35 .:bpalmer:.	I mean, if you're going to the effort of installing random programs, etc; you could just install emacs 28 in your home dir
Dec 08 18:30:57 .:amartinez:.	it doesn't work in 28 either.
Dec 08 18:31:16 .:bpalmer:.	the python.el that ships with emacs 28 doesn't support match?
Dec 08 18:31:27 .:amartinez:.	not on either of my fedora systems, no.
Dec 08 18:31:29 .:grym:.	probably not
Dec 08 18:31:45 .:bpalmer:.	oh, so it doesn't.
Dec 08 18:31:53 .:pkal:.	(didn't follow the entire discussion) python.el is distributed on ELPA
Dec 08 18:31:58 .:bpalmer:.	I don't think much of match, so never tried it.
Dec 08 18:32:26 .:amartinez:.	I prefer match to a million ifs
Dec 08 18:32:33 .:amartinez:.	but at this point I'll just.. .stick to the ifs.
Dec 08 18:32:35 .:grym:.	amartinez: dispatch dict is also a nice pattern
Dec 08 18:32:48 .:grym:.	with a .get(), you even have a default case
Dec 08 18:32:51 .:bpalmer:.	python's got you there. Can't have more than 100 if/elifs at a time.
Dec 08 18:33:14 .:corwin:.	the latest version of python on GNU ELPA is from Feb of this year; that's why I suggested looking at MELPA or master
Dec 08 18:33:25 .:bpalmer:.	saving you from a million cases like a boss.
Dec 08 18:33:32 .:amartinez:.	heh
Dec 08 18:34:02 .:pkal:.	corwin: does the MELPA package also mirror the package from emacs.git?
Dec 08 18:34:20 .:amartinez:.	I'm really overcomplicating what I need - was just curious if I COULD get python.el to work with match/case
Dec 08 18:34:32 .:grym:.	{SOMEENUM:callable, OTHERENUM:anothercallable}.get(thevalue, defaultcallable)(*args)
Dec 08 18:34:42 .:amartinez:.	try/except and handle a 429 with a wait and retry is fine
Dec 08 18:35:16 .:amartinez:.	or if I really want match semantics I could just rewrite the whole thing in Rust and look even busier ;)
Dec 08 18:35:32 .:grym:.	or deal without highlighting and write valid matches
Dec 08 18:35:39 .:bpalmer:.	(OK, in theory python match isn't terrible -- it's less ugly than elisp's pcase, I guess; but in practice, the arbitrary nature of the x vs foo.x match case just seems like a trap waiting to happen)
Dec 08 18:35:58 .:amartinez:.	grym: but the I'd have to hit the spacebar a bunch of times
Dec 08 18:36:07 .:amartinez:.	almost as difficult as switching languages ;)

Dec 08 18:38:12 .:EdwardIII:.	you'll write rust and you'll _like_ it!
Dec 08 18:38:20 .:corwin:.	pkal: I haven't the foggiest.  I'm not sure I've ever loaded any version of python-mode
Dec 08 18:38:21 .:amartinez:.	I actually *do* like Rust
Dec 08 18:38:58 .:amartinez:.	but I wrote this library in Python 5+yrs ago when I originally worked for $currentJob
Dec 08 18:39:14 .:amartinez:.	which happens to also be oldJob[1]
Dec 08 18:39:32 .:pkal:.	corwin: I ask because there is python.el and python-mode.el, and I suspenct that MELPA has the latter
Dec 08 18:41:16 .:bpalmer:.	it's possible that python-mode.el supports match and amartinez would want ot try it out
Dec 08 18:41:20 .:bpalmer:.	I used ot significantly prefer python-mode
Dec 08 18:41:26 .:amartinez:.	at least my list-packages shows python-mode.el from MELPA and python.el from GNU
Dec 08 18:42:01 .:amartinez:.	my "understanding" is that python.el from github is no more, was taken over and is now builtin.
Dec 08 18:42:02 .:quiliro:.	pjb: for every car circulating on the left, there are 2 circulating on the right.
Dec 08 18:42:54 .:amartinez:.	rather than hop editors again, I'll get this sorted on a non-work machine
Dec 08 18:43:26 .:amartinez:.	and think more about whether I actually have a need for a match/case in this code or if I'm just complicating things and forcing a newer python than need be.
Dec 08 18:43:50 .:amartinez:.	thanks for the suggestions folks. appreciate it.

Dec 08 18:56:11 .:quiliro:.	I think that "Communication is not my strength." is not correct.

Dec 08 18:57:30 .:quiliro:.	It still sounds cranky.  How do you say that in English.

Dec 09 07:10:35 .:mictty:.	my life is totally fucked but i am coding. I think i am little bit crazy
Dec 09 07:21:34 .:chocolate:.	I am running emacs on wsl2 (wslg) and everything is working as expected except for frame management.
Dec 09 07:22:58 .:chocolate:.	specifically, I can create new frame via c-x 5 2, but moving to another frame is not workign as expected (other-frame or c-x 5 o). I wonder if this is an issue local to my setup or if thiis a common problem for wsl users
Dec 09 07:24:31 .:corwin:.	chocolate: I don't have this issue with the Windows native binaries so I suspect it's wsl or else your config.  Have you duplicated the issues under emacs -Q?
Dec 09 07:30:52 .:chocolate:.	yes, it is the same result in with a fresh config. I suspect that it is a wslg thing but i'm unable to come up with a good explanation
Dec 09 07:33:13 .:corwin:.	just to be clear: emacs -Q is not quite the same as a fresh config
Dec 09 07:33:47 .:parsnip:.	chocolate: how did you install emacs? and are you using a starter kit like spacemacs, doom, nix, guix?
Dec 09 07:35:06 .:chocolate:.	i've compiled from source. I am going to do make a fresh distro and install via package manager to see if it is just something i messed up.
Dec 09 07:35:37 .:parsnip:.	chocolate: okay, but did you try with emacs -Q?
Dec 09 07:35:43 .:parsnip:.	are you not sure how to find emacs -Q?
Dec 09 07:36:19 .:parsnip:.	maybe it's like `./run-emacs.exe -Q` or something
Dec 09 07:36:24 .:chocolate:.	yea i tried starting my process with 'emacs -Q' without any change in behavior (w.r.t. frames anyway)
Dec 09 07:36:25 .:parsnip:.	running it in terminal
Dec 09 07:36:35 .:parsnip:.	okay, thank you for clarifying
Dec 09 07:36:56 .:parsnip:.	and the frames were GUI i assume, not stuck in a terminal
Dec 09 07:37:05 .:parsnip:.	C-x 5 2 acts funny in terminal
Dec 09 07:37:31 .:chocolate:.	yep, this is all gui based.
Dec 09 07:39:04 .:corwin:.	in this case, from a -Q session I suggest running M-x report-emacs-bug
Dec 09 07:39:36 .:corwin:.	It's also worth hanging out here to see if someone else happens by who has run into this.
Dec 09 07:42:51 .:chocolate:.	corwin: that is my hope. Google yielded little insight into the issue.
Dec 09 07:44:18 .:chocolate:.	fwiw, a freshly installed ubuntu environment and installing emacs via apt results in the same thing
Dec 09 07:45:25 .:corwin:.	I suspect you are headed for a bug report.  I know the windows port (binaries made with mingw) are supported; I'm not actually sure about wsl
Dec 09 07:48:52 .:parsnip:.	i couldn't get wslg to work on my windows machine
