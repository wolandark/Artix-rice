Dec 08 17:20:24 .:woland:.	hi, I just installed qutebrowser with virtual env and Im getting this error http://0x0.st/odQ7.txt
Dec 08 17:21:09 .:woland:.	the browser launches with "ERROR: Renderer process crashed (status 31)" and doesnt render anything except for a white page
Dec 08 17:21:20 .:woland:.	OS is Arch
Dec 08 17:27:56 <The-Compiler>	woland: the QtWebEngine coming with a virtualenv install is too old to run properly on Arch. Why not install via the Arch package?
Dec 08 17:23:55 .:woland:.	because it just broke. complaining about missing qtwebengine even though it is installed and qutebrowser was running fine until two hours ago.
Dec 08 17:24:36 .:woland:.	I've been searching everywhere and trying everything to fix it but nothing worked
Dec 08 17:30:31 .:woland:.	http://0x0.st/od1r.txt here is the error from official arch repo, same goes for qutebrowser-git from aur and also the qt6 version

Dec 08 17:44:35 .:woland:.	how can I unset QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS='-blink-settings=darkModeEnabled=tlayScrollbarFlashWhenMouseEnter ? and what does "Consider using the qt.args qutebrowser setting instead" mean?
Dec 08 17:45:09 .:woland:.	I really cant switch to another browser, qutebrowser is perfect, any help is much appreciated 
Dec 08 17:53:04 <nimaje>	woland: hm, partial upgrade? "libre2.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
Dec 08 17:48:23 .:woland:.	nimaje:  I did a full system upgrade with sudo pacman -Syu just a couple hours ago
Dec 08 17:56:36 .:nimaje:.	did that upgrade libre2 and/or qt-webengine?
Dec 08 17:51:44 nimaje Nickli nicolai_dag ninewise Nintendo nixi 
Dec 08 17:51:47 .:woland:.	nimaje:  it did 
Dec 08 18:01:10 .:nimaje:.	which of them? the only explanation for that error message that I have is that libre2 got rebuild and changed SOABI, but qt-webengine wasn't rebuild as it should then
Dec 08 17:56:19 .:woland:.	I specifically saw qt-webengine I dont think that I saw libre2 upgrading
Dec 08 17:57:19 .:woland:.	whats the full name of libre2?
Dec 08 17:58:00 .:woland:.	i think its re2 on arch
Dec 08 17:58:54 .:woland:.	https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/re2/files/
Dec 08 18:05:19 .:nimaje:.	seems to be https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/re2/ and acording to that, qt-webengine was rebuild too, so no idea why it searchs for a nonexisting file
Dec 08 18:05:06 »»	woland sad noises
Dec 08 18:05:34 .:woland:.	I'll give it a few days, next upgrades might fix it
Dec 08 18:11:46 .:nimaje:.	does it for some reason try to use some other qt-webengine?
Dec 08 18:07:51 .:woland:.	how can I confirm that?

Dec 09 05:47:38 <The-Compiler>	woland: Judging from the second error you posted, you have a second PyQt5/Qt installation in your home: "QtWebKit: cannot import name 'QtWebKit' from 'PyQt5' (/home/woland/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PyQt5/__init__.py)". I'd try a "pip uninstall PyQt5" to get rid of that. (This message has been postponed on 2022-12-08 18:07:00.)
Dec 09 05:43:02 .:woland:.	The-Compiler: I did remove the packages I had stupidly installed from pip based on a similar comment of yours on reddit.
Dec 09 05:45:59 .:woland:.	the problem is solved now, I just upgraded qt5-webengine 5.15.11-3 and qt6-webengine 6.4.1-2 and reinstalled qutebrowser from the official repos which pulled python-pyqt5-webengine 5.15.6-1
Dec 09 05:46:14 .:woland:.	my fav browser is back to normal now :)
Dec 09 05:46:39 .:woland:.	qutebrowser version 2.5.2-2
Dec 09 05:47:10 .:woland:.	thanks for the help everyone and thanks for this great browser The-Compiler <3
