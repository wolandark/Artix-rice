Nov 14 01:38:49 .:n00b:.	SGOrava: they have cases that have BT keyboards
Nov 14 01:39:06 .:SGOrava:.	n00b: what ?
Nov 14 01:39:24 .:n00b:.	they have cases with slide out keyboards for phones
Nov 14 01:39:51 .:SGOrava:.	I will rather go with keyboard for pinephone which is WIRED
Nov 14 01:39:58 .:n00b:.	sure
Nov 14 01:40:03 .:SGOrava:.	these wireless tricks keep away from me
Nov 14 01:40:27 .:SGOrava:.	n00b: the biggest problem I see with modern phones is that they are all the same and way too big
Nov 14 01:40:36 .:SGOrava:.	that is why I want a small slider phone
Nov 14 01:40:43 .:n00b:.	meh. they make bid and small
Nov 14 01:40:52 .:SGOrava:.	I do not like the flip-flop ones, the slider is the best
Nov 14 01:41:24 .:n00b:.	I had a sprint ... something with the slide out keyboard
Nov 14 01:41:36 .:SGOrava:.	provide an example of modern phone you are talking about, which has a proper sliding keys (NOT the qwerty mess)
Nov 14 01:42:17 .:SGOrava:.	I spent a bit of time searching and I was unable to find one
Nov 14 01:42:32 .:SGOrava:.	I know of the chinese "restored" phones, but that is not it
Nov 14 01:42:57 .:n00b:.	https://www.boxwave.com/apple-iphone-6-cases-and-covers/keyboard-buddy-apple-iphone-6-case/bwpdd/pkz-pkgw/
Nov 14 01:43:07 .:SGOrava:.	As a part of my research I used this site: https://www.gsmarena.com/
Nov 14 01:43:09 .:n00b:.	is that what you mean?
Nov 14 01:43:46 .:SGOrava:.	n00b: that is exactly what I do NOT want :D
Nov 14 01:44:06 .:SGOrava:.	with that example you probably checked all checkmarks for what I do not want :D
Nov 14 01:45:16 .:n00b:.	what part of that is undesired? 
Nov 14 01:46:53 .:SGOrava:.	- apple iphone device: these devices will not cross my house
Nov 14 01:47:30 .:SGOrava:.	- bluetooth keyboard: why should I use bluetooth for something which will be PERMANENTLYT attached to the device?
Nov 14 01:48:07 .:n00b:.	oh. because they do not make a device like you want. so only way is BT
Nov 14 01:48:09 .:SGOrava:.	- keyboard: I want an old style keyboard normal 123 456 789 #0*
Nov 14 01:48:44 .:n00b:.	ah, 4 row
Nov 14 01:48:51 .:n00b:.	my sprint had that
Nov 14 01:49:11 .:SGOrava:.	the normal phone which can be used normally with newer technology.
Nov 14 01:49:22 .:n00b:.	I guess a usb connection could have value.
Nov 14 01:49:50 .:SGOrava:.	It is shame that when you want to buy a normal phone you need to either buy an old used one or yo buy some cheap thing for seniors 
Nov 14 01:50:01 .:n00b:.	interesting. ingogo a phone addon that fills usb, is a 4 row slide out
Nov 14 01:50:20 .:SGOrava:.	pinephone has pohopins on the back, this kind of sliding keyboord might work there
Nov 14 01:50:28 .:n00b:.	sur
Nov 14 01:50:54 .:SGOrava:.	I do not want a "phone addon" for which phone would that be? do they make a small phones like that? 
Nov 14 01:51:17 .:SGOrava:.	the modern phones look more like "attach a long handle and go row the water on a boat"
Nov 14 01:51:34 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2Fhdcfo3Wis3PJDj4KbZtpVf.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomshardware.com%2Fnews%2Fraspberry-pi-mutantc-v2-project&tbnid=YbVKfGX3n7XQiM&vet=12ahUKEwib5NnSmKz7AhXMoI4IHTgpD_sQMygGegUIARDkAQ..i&docid=iKc1IH6kB7rFmM&w=1152&h=648&q=pi%20phone%20sliding%20keyboard&ved=2ahUKEwib5NnSmKz7AhXMoI4IHTgpD_sQMygGegUIARDkAQ
Nov 14 01:51:59 .:SGOrava:.	what is this spoam?
Nov 14 01:52:12 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	a phone idea?
Nov 14 01:52:18 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	tom's hardware
Nov 14 01:52:33 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	pi
Nov 14 01:52:41 .:SGOrava:.	send a normal link, the google is 3 rows long, not gonna to copy it
Nov 14 01:53:05 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	ffs
Nov 14 01:53:08 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-mutantc-v2-project
Nov 14 01:53:47 .:SGOrava:.	if that hand is from normal sized man, it is sized as handheld game consoles and not like a phone
Nov 14 01:54:14 .:SGOrava:.	the things I want are not made anymore... very sad. There is only this junk
Nov 14 01:54:25 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	so make something?
Nov 14 01:54:29 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	3d print
Nov 14 01:55:17 .:SGOrava:.	that is impossible
Nov 14 01:56:36 .:SGOrava:.	I want a small device, that is hard to make. If I wanted a big one I would not bother searching 
Nov 14 02:01:11 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	https://hackaday.io/project/168387-physical-keyboard-for-any-android-phone
Nov 14 02:02:03 .:SGOrava:.	that is still a paddle phone
Nov 14 02:03:06 .:SGOrava:.	it is not about attaching some keyboard to a paddle. It is about having a normal phone with normal keys and small like at most 3inch screen size. so that is can be small
Nov 14 02:03:43 .:SGOrava:.	who wants to go on internet with a phone ? use a tablet or laptop. the modern phones are far too big because they are not phones but a tablets
Nov 14 02:04:14 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i had a sanyo 9000 candybar phone i liked a lot
Nov 14 02:04:42 .:SGOrava:.	yeah, I could create something which I would like but I do not want to play with all of that, I just want to have it and throw it into the corner to forget it
Nov 14 02:05:07 .:SGOrava:.	like a phone should be, forgotten in the dark corner used only when needed
Nov 14 02:05:39 .:SGOrava:.	use a device which fits the purpose you want to do; the smartphone can do nothing properly and is a huge mess.
Nov 14 02:06:04 .:SGOrava:.	I know, this turned iunto a "rant" but that is how it is
Nov 14 02:07:06 .:SGOrava:.	VelvetVoodoo: I had Samsung C3050 in the past and I realyt like the form factor, it was nice to use. it has fallen apart after that
Nov 14 02:09:17 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	https://www.ebay.com/itm/175369250957?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28&var=474626257751&srsltid=AYJSbAc04VH9bM-xT8uZCb7EdAENLzf7-7aiII97W1Zc_LCWW5qkYe_vGyg
Nov 14 02:17:57 .:SGOrava:.	still it is not a sliding one.
Nov 14 02:18:13 .:SGOrava:.	and they are out of stock
Nov 14 02:18:17 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i prefer that to sliding tbh...but i get it
Nov 14 02:20:02 .:SGOrava:.	you can call it obsession or my mulfunction
Nov 14 02:21:09 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	lol
Nov 14 02:22:19 .:SGOrava:.	yeah, I might be too old already
Nov 14 02:28:17 .:SGOrava:.	VelvetVoodoo: like this one https://bestdumbphones.com/samsung-sgh-a777-att/

Nov 14 02:29:57 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	:D
Nov 14 02:34:42 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	samsung sgh-t429 looks kinda similar
Nov 14 02:35:36 .:SGOrava:.	they all kinda look similar, it is from samsung after all.
Nov 14 02:36:04 .:SGOrava:.	at the moment I do not want to hunt for an old device
Nov 14 02:36:26 .:SGOrava:.	I can only hope I will find a new old stock
Nov 14 02:36:42 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i'm just looking for morbid curiousity
Nov 14 02:40:03 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	https://www.alibaba.com/pla/Free-Shipping-For-Nokia-N96-Hot_11000002409941.html?mark=google_shopping&biz=pla&searchText=mobile+phones&product_id=11000002409941&language=en
Nov 14 02:42:27 .:SGOrava:.	yeah, nokia serries also caught my eye
Nov 14 02:42:49 .:SGOrava:.	the N95 or N91 it was? are good but also too old
Nov 14 02:42:51 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	the unihertz titan is kinda interesting

Nov 14 02:44:11 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	n95
Nov 14 02:44:37 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	sony/ericsson w595

Nov 14 02:45:50 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	ya
Nov 14 02:45:54 .:SGOrava:.	but a bit expensive... well good stuff are expensive
Nov 14 02:47:05 .:SGOrava:.	I will realy consider this one to gert alongside the portable computer (pinephone)
Nov 14 02:49:03 .:SGOrava:.	https://www.unihertz.com/products/atom
Nov 14 02:49:20 .:SGOrava:.	this one is realy interesting. should be able to take a bad mood
Nov 14 02:49:52 .:SGOrava:.	I mean should withstand the harsh environment
Nov 14 02:51:02 .:SGOrava:.	but is also a bit pricy.... hard to decide, will ponder over it during work

Nov 14 03:08:09 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	the titan reminds me of my treo
Nov 14 03:09:03 .:SGOrava:.	yeah, no keyboard but in this size I might forgive it...
Nov 14 03:09:10 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	:)
Nov 14 03:09:23 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i do like the paddles if they are durable and clicky
Nov 14 03:10:38 .:SGOrava:.	it depoends on the usecase. I almost do not use the additional features... but it is very hard to find a good phone
Nov 14 03:10:55 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	hotspot is super handy
Nov 14 03:11:12 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	especially if you wanna use maps or something on tablet
Nov 14 03:11:27 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	or bt for car stereo
Nov 14 03:11:55 .:SGOrava:.	you should have offline pams
Nov 14 03:11:59 .:SGOrava:.	*maps
Nov 14 03:12:30 .:SGOrava:.	maps are great but you realy need offline maps, the online ones are only a gimmick
Nov 14 03:12:50 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i use google maps every time i drive
Nov 14 03:13:02 .:SGOrava:.	I walk
Nov 14 03:13:06 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i wish
Nov 14 03:13:16 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	you can't do that easily in us
Nov 14 03:13:18 .:SGOrava:.	step by step
Nov 14 03:13:34 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	not convenient at all here
Nov 14 03:13:47 .:SGOrava:.	yeah, I saw the streets in the US on some videos and the whole desing is like post-apocaliptic ..
Nov 14 03:14:07 .:SGOrava:.	so empty, people nowhere, only robots .. sorry cars
Nov 14 03:15:17 .:SGOrava:.	I can walk here just fine, it is great to free your mind. Step by step, it feels so natural
Nov 14 03:15:21 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	this explains it well   https://youtu.be/ORzNZUeUHAM
Nov 14 03:15:41 .:SGOrava:.	saw that a while ago, that is why I know
Nov 14 03:16:07 .:SGOrava:.	I think someone in US thought: How to make people lives miserable while they will feel happy?
Nov 14 03:16:45 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	lol
Nov 14 03:17:19 .:SGOrava:.	should it be lifes or lives? I lost it there.
Nov 14 03:17:55 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	lives
Nov 14 03:18:03 .:SGOrava:.	Thank you
Nov 14 03:19:04 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	if you get the atom i wanna know what you think irl   :)
Nov 14 03:19:17 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	my next might be a pinephone
Nov 14 03:19:24 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	are you happy with it?
Nov 14 03:19:28 .:SGOrava:.	pinephone is very big
Nov 14 03:19:46 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	i have an lg v20 atm
Nov 14 03:19:54 .:SGOrava:.	I dont know, I seemsed to have a faulty sim card which was from time to time not working...
Nov 14 03:20:02 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	:/
Nov 14 03:20:14 .:SGOrava:.	it is not very "fast" and I did not play with it a lot.
Nov 14 03:20:30 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	aww
Nov 14 03:20:52 .:SGOrava:.	I bought it with some manjaro kde thing and later I put postmarket os woth posh on it
Nov 14 03:21:09 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	convergence is convenient...but i like separate devices too if they are designed well
Nov 14 03:21:12 .:SGOrava:.	it runs fine I would say. the basics are there but I truly do not use the advanced features
Nov 14 03:22:04 .:SGOrava:.	to clarify I also like when the device can do more things but I like more when device is built for some purpose. I have my music player, ebook reader, laptop, pc and "smartphone"
Nov 14 03:22:32 .:SGOrava:.	it may sound crazy but phones are not great. it is just mean to track you
Nov 14 03:23:18 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	and you pay through the nose for the priviledge   :)
Nov 14 03:24:21 .:SGOrava:.	it count the number of bees you got :D
Nov 14 03:25:10 .:SGOrava:.	well, I told everyone that my "mobile" phone is actualy fixed and rarely moves and thus I will often miss the calls :D
Nov 14 03:27:19 .:SGOrava:.	VelvetVoodoo: I am not a good man to ask if pinephone is great or not. I mostl play with my PC, I use it rarely
Nov 14 03:27:44 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	anecdata is good though   :)
Nov 14 03:27:55 .:VelvetVoodoo:.	thanks for sharing
Nov 14 03:30:37 .:SGOrava:.	at least it is mostly free opensource device and software so much better than the android mess out there
Nov 14 03:31:16 .:SGOrava:.	the smartphones.. each one is totally unique
Nov 14 03:31:32 .:SGOrava:.	while they all look the smae
Nov 14 03:42:42 .:SGOrava:.	*same

Nov 18 14:00:38 .:hoel:.	Any error log?
Nov 18 14:01:55 .:woland:.	hoel: the log is empty
Nov 18 14:14:39 .:hoel:.	Does the v2ray command exist?
Nov 18 14:15:10 .:hoel:.	Most probably that’s a shell issue (or your executable exits without a word, which wouldn’t be nice of him).
Nov 18 14:10:01 .:woland:.	yes v2ray exists
Nov 18 14:10:12 .:woland:.	shellchecker is actually complaining
Nov 18 14:10:23 .:woland:.	run|2 col 18 warning| Not following: ./conf was not specified as input (se    e shellcheck -x). [SC1091]    
Nov 18 14:16:03 .:hoel:.	Yeah, it does not know what happens in that conf file.
Nov 18 14:16:09 .:hoel:.	What’s its content?
Nov 18 14:11:20 .:woland:.	https://0x0.st/oIRi.txt
Nov 18 14:17:45 .:hoel:.	Oh, I meant the ./conf file, not the /etc/v2ray/config.json file.
Nov 18 14:12:44 .:woland:.	where is that?
Nov 18 14:18:53 .:hoel:.	In the same directory as the run file you uploaded earlier.
Nov 18 14:18:57 .:hoel:.	It may not exist.
Nov 18 14:15:10 .:woland:.	it doesnt exists 
Nov 18 14:21:05 .:hoel:.	What happens if you run the command manually as root?
Nov 18 14:17:02 .:woland:.	it says that its runing using config from stdin
Nov 18 14:17:13 .:woland:.	but doesnt actually do anything
Nov 18 14:23:57 .:hoel:.	It says it uses config from stdin when you run /usr/bin/v2ray -config /etc/v2ray/config.json?
Nov 18 14:20:09 .:woland:.	oh like that
Nov 18 14:20:11 .:woland:.	it says
Nov 18 14:20:13 .:woland:.	flag provided but not defined: -config
Nov 18 14:26:58 .:hoel:.	And if you run /usr/bin/v2ray -config=/etc/v2ray/config.json?
Nov 18 14:27:06 .:hoel:.	(Note the equal sign)
Nov 18 14:22:05 .:woland:.	same 
Nov 18 14:30:14 .:hoel:.	Uh
Nov 18 14:30:21 .:hoel:.	I don’t know then, sorry.

Dec 07 05:30:46 .:axreios:.	I saw someone in the forum wrote about a notice while booting that included \-\-.  I think this is coming from /etc/init.d/hwclock.  I have the same notice at boot.  FWIW
Dec 07 05:34:31 .:axreios:.	I don't know who manages the openrc package so I thought I would mention this here.  Adios!
Dec 07 06:25:23 .:mrbrklyn:.	why not use ntp for the clock?  Hardware clocks tend to be unreliable over time
