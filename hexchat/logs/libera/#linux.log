Nov 13 22:18:18 <xiaomiao>	epony: the 'good' SSD/NVMe don't have that issue, but cost a lot more (and tend to be a lot more power-hungry))
Nov 13 22:18:22 <xiaomiao>	it's all tradeoffs :)
Nov 13 22:18:42 <epony>	and the dram memory / nand flash memory shortage is not helping the SSD world domination either

Nov 14 02:18:58 .:sumthing1980:.	anyone have experience with ansi codes? server cant know what col/rows the client display has right ?
Nov 14 02:19:02 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: I had my daily driver die precipitously in mid September and I decided to upgrade as I replaced it. I would have loved to resolve that for only 700.
Nov 14 02:19:37 .:phogg:.	sumthing1980: yes, and no, and not exactly
Nov 14 02:19:39 .:NyB:.	phogg: what was it and what did you do go to?
Nov 14 02:20:11 .:sumthing1980:.	I mean does a terminal send to the server ever, how many cols x rows it displays ?
Nov 14 02:20:20 .:hangint3n:.	When you have been in the computer world for over 30 years, you see just how fast what is new becomes obsolete...
Nov 14 02:20:25 .:phogg:.	sumthing1980: a terminal may communicate its rows/cols, and might even do so accurately, and for a terminal emulator it might even change the value as the containing window size changes
Nov 14 02:20:34 .:rbox:.	sumthing1980: what do you mean "the server"
Nov 14 02:20:39 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: that is really unfortunate
Nov 14 02:20:40 .:phogg:.	sumthing1980: whether anything running in the terminal reacts is another matter
Nov 14 02:20:50 .:sumthing1980:.	the server / port you connect to
Nov 14 02:21:07 .:sumthing1980:.	that is not the terminal program
Nov 14 02:21:13 .:NyB:.	hangint3n: dunno, my 7yo skylake is still pretty decent for what I'm using it for
Nov 14 02:21:16 .:rbox:.	sumthing1980: huh?
Nov 14 02:21:43 .:hangint3n:.	I'm curios. How many here are using terminals for there irc and how many are web based?
Nov 14 02:21:45 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: I went through a lot of bad hardware and quite a bit of "that wasn't what I really needed to buy" hardware. I spent over 10k, not counting money refunded. The good news is I got almost 4 working systems out of it, so I won
Nov 14 02:21:53 .:rbox:.	hangint3n: thats the only 2 options?
Nov 14 02:21:58 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: won't need to buy any toy systems for a while
Nov 14 02:22:12 .:bmr:.	winning seems relative here :P
Nov 14 02:22:24 .:sumthing1980:.	Im making a telnet server on pc A , pc B connects to it and displays whatver it t sends, A sends ansi codes to B , like write stuff on random row, but to know how many max rows it has, B needs to send that info to A somehow
Nov 14 02:22:53 .:rbox:.	sumthing1980: sounds like you're reinventing a lot of wheels
Nov 14 02:22:57 .:NyB:.	sumthing1980: is this a theoretical question, or do you actually have a problem to solve?
Nov 14 02:23:18 .:bmr:.	you are answering him wrong
Nov 14 02:23:22 .:bmr:.	here is the correct answer:
Nov 14 02:23:53 .:sumthing1980:.	I think pc A cannot know number of rows/cols unless it asks, right ?
Nov 14 02:23:59 .:hangint3n:.	NyB: skylake is getting a bit old don't you think? but I guess it really depends on how it is being used.
Nov 14 02:24:08 .:phogg:.	sumthing1980: you can't know anything by magic, no
Nov 14 02:24:10 .:bmr:.	sumthing1980: that will never happen, serial connections are inheritly one-way and you need to pre-negotiate before establishing and sending / recieving. its not an TTY.
Nov 14 02:24:24 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: 10K, Yikees!
Nov 14 02:24:42 .:bmr:.	you will have to set it like 115200/N/8
Nov 14 02:24:54 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: mistakes were made, but I also gauged specs for "no upgrades for 5-10 years"
Nov 14 02:24:55 .:bmr:.	for 115k baud, no parity bit and 8 bits packetsize
Nov 14 02:25:00 .:NyB:.	hangint3n: coding, internet, some light gaming
Nov 14 02:25:17 .:sumthing1980:.	Ive done a telnet server already but number of rows it has to ask, I just needed a yes to confirm
Nov 14 02:25:41 .:Sauvin:.	Heh, can't order pizza. Web site hangs. Such lameness.
Nov 14 02:25:42 .:phogg:.	sumthing1980: it ALWAYS has to ask (or be told).
Nov 14 02:25:59 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: haven't you heard? Nobody uses web sites any more, it's all about apps now.
Nov 14 02:26:26 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: why use a mishmash of open standards that works on any platform when you can get locked in to a binary that only runs on a vendor-specific platform?
Nov 14 02:26:28 .:Sauvin:.	Except that I don't trust my phone not to broadcast all my private stuff everywhere I go.
Nov 14 02:26:49 .:skered:.	order pizza via bitcoin like the good ol' days.
Nov 14 02:27:33 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: There's no point in worrying about that if you already provide structured information on yourself via social media sites and keep it up to date on a daily basis. Think of all the time it saves the spooks! You're doing them a service.
Nov 14 02:28:00 .:hangint3n:.	Okay I'm off, back to finishing "The Irishman"
Nov 14 02:28:43 .:Sauvin:.	I don't provide any info about myself to social media.
Nov 14 02:28:52 .:phogg:.	weirdo
Nov 14 02:29:32 .:hangint3n:.	What kinda person has no social media presense at all?
Nov 14 02:29:44 .:Sauvin:.	"presense"?
Nov 14 02:29:54 .:hangint3n:.	yeah that
Nov 14 02:30:01 .:hangint3n:.	lol
Nov 14 02:30:20 .:sumthing1980:.	thats from the movie minority report
Nov 14 02:30:36 .:Sauvin:.	That's "precrime", I think.
Nov 14 02:30:36 .:NyB:.	I think I have like three social media posts over 10 years or so. Two of them where to maybe shame companies into not ignoring me...
Nov 14 02:30:41 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: the kind that cares about privacy
Nov 14 02:30:54 .:NyB:.	s/where/were/
Nov 14 02:30:55 .:sumthing1980:.	hmm maybe
Nov 14 02:30:59 .:rascul:.	i only use social media for dog videos
Nov 14 02:31:16 .:Sauvin:.	Nobody IRL knows who I am on the Web, and very, very few people on the web know who I am IRL.
Nov 14 02:31:33 .:rascul:.	indy racing league?
Nov 14 02:31:34 .:kfrench:.	I'm not real
Nov 14 02:31:43 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: I don't know anyone that careful. Well one, but he is dead.  Won't even let his picture be taken. Again dead.
Nov 14 02:31:44 .:Sauvin:.	rascul, you got it all wrong. It's all about the cute little mewling kittens!
Nov 14 02:31:50 .:phogg:.	There's nothing wrong with social media sites so long as they forbid you from connecting meatspace identity information and do not share user metadata with third parties at all.
Nov 14 02:31:58 .:phogg:.	otherwise they're evil
Nov 14 02:32:03 .:mikehaggar:.	what? you mean you aren't the same Sauvin I work with?  /mindblown
Nov 14 02:32:50 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: I don't do social media and I don't have pictures on the internet with my face AND my name associated. It's not hard, you just have to believe in the value.
Nov 14 02:33:54 .:hangint3n:.	My experience is that the harder you try to hide the more certain enities what do know why?
Nov 14 02:34:31 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: ever heard of defense in depth?
Nov 14 02:34:38 .:hangint3n:.	The absence of infomation is a big flag.
Nov 14 02:34:46 .:Sauvin:.	Yup, the doofuses changed something on the web site and is now unusable. This is an affront to people who cannot use a phone.
Nov 14 02:34:55 .:NyB:.	for me it's more like "ain't nobody got time for that"...
Nov 14 02:35:00 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: the first step to maintaining privacy is not informing on yourself. Do the minimum. Maybe you can't stay hidden, but you can reduce your surface area.
Nov 14 02:35:28 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: a big flag that says something, but who knows what?
Nov 14 02:35:30 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: that I understand..
Nov 14 02:35:51 .:NyB:.	I find social media incredibly time consuming
Nov 14 02:36:00 .:Sauvin:.	It can be.
Nov 14 02:36:31 .:NyB:.	IRC is too, I suppose, but IRC has less interest if you are not participating
Nov 14 02:36:54 .:phogg:.	tragically even with all that discipline ALL my personal data was lost in the OPM hack, so it's probably something you can buy on the black market. But, at least companies can't buy it legally from Facebook
Nov 14 02:37:28 .:NyB:.	social media drags you into this constant update maelstrom, where you get "news" from people you think you know
Nov 14 02:37:44 .:Sauvin:.	PSA: Domino's are idiots.
Nov 14 02:37:49 .:hangint3n:.	If I was an information gather, I'd expend significant $$$ for those I preceived are trying to stay under the radar.
Nov 14 02:37:52 .:phogg:.	NyB: the dividing line is consent and anonymity. Social media tends to be explicitly non-anonymous, IRC is pseud-anonymous (and you more or less consent to your exposure)
Nov 14 02:38:01 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: could have told you that!
Nov 14 02:38:21 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: Even more reason more of us with nothing to hide should stay hidden.
Nov 14 02:38:30 .:NyB:.	so you get groups of people broadcasting their lives, and having the illusion that they are communicating with other people because others do the same
Nov 14 02:38:31 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: to help protect those who need it
Nov 14 02:38:48 »»	Laurenceb is now known as Laurence_b
Nov 14 02:38:57 .:phogg:.	NyB: it's definitely a lifestyle choice, but not one I think most people would make on purpose
Nov 14 02:39:24 .:NyB:.	phogg: there is significant peer pressure :-(
Nov 14 02:39:33 .:phogg:.	NyB: screw 'em
Nov 14 02:39:41 .:NyB:.	like "what, not pictures from your Maui vacation?"
Nov 14 02:39:49 .:NyB:.	etc etc
Nov 14 02:39:55 .:NyB:.	I'm not bothered by it...
Nov 14 02:40:00 .:phogg:.	if people want to talk to me they can find me on IRC, via email, or IM (discord these days). People not willing to put in the effort aren't really my friends.
Nov 14 02:40:08 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: Yup and there are those out there right now that need proctection.
Nov 14 02:41:43 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: Privacy as you know is a balancing act. We all need to find our centre.
Nov 14 02:42:23 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: it's more opsec than privacy, and like all forms of security it's a *process* and not an outcome (or a state), and it takes a lot of layers
Nov 14 02:42:56 .:rascul:.	i use layers in cold weather
Nov 14 02:44:55 .:hangint3n:.	NyB: I've posted vac. pictures just never while on vacation...
Nov 14 02:45:25 .:bmr:.	still
Nov 14 02:45:29 .:bmr:.	canadian dollars
Nov 14 02:45:42 .:rascul:.	what are the best kind of dollars?
Nov 14 02:45:44 .:phogg:.	strip the EXIF, doctor the timestamps and lat/lon, fake your vacation time/place
Nov 14 02:45:53 .:bmr:.	you can actually buy computerstuff for canadian dollars
Nov 14 02:45:55 .:hangint3n:.	If I was serious about my security I would not be on Irc

Nov 14 02:46:36 .:xmppswiley:.	Plastic monopoly money
Nov 14 02:46:39 .:bmr:.	i watch southpark, they say canada is strange
Nov 14 02:46:53 .:xmppswiley:.	I absolutely love Canada.
Nov 14 02:46:59 .:rascul:.	i wonder if you can buy computer stuff with fijian dollars
Nov 14 02:47:11 .:bmr:.	whats that
Nov 14 02:47:26 .:xmppswiley:.	It's so cozy and the build these tiny little houses right ontop of eachother
Nov 14 02:47:30 .:rascul:.	dollars from fiji i guess
Nov 14 02:47:35 .:hangint3n:.	I believe that the "plastic money" has I higher level of security... but I could be wrong and I'm ready to be corrected.
Nov 14 02:47:46 .:bmr:.	nah
Nov 14 02:47:58 .:phogg:.	bmr: south park is not known for being a source of factual data
Nov 14 02:48:13 .:xmppswiley:.	Almost everything is coastal too so there are boats and tiny planes everywhere
Nov 14 02:48:16 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: plastic money is better by nearly every metric
Nov 14 02:48:27 .:bmr:.	linus is from canada, also they play well hockey and give us swedes some competition
Nov 14 02:48:34 .:bmr:.	bet they are all good!
Nov 14 02:48:55 .:bmr:.	stalin was from canada too
Nov 14 02:49:11 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: the only major issue is access: if your supply chain for material/equipment needed to print your sovereign paper currency depends on foreign entities which may become unavailable or hostile, that's a national security concern
Nov 14 02:49:17 .:xmppswiley:.	Also they're all Whites or Asians and they're super friendly
Nov 14 02:49:52 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: agreed
Nov 14 02:50:01 .:rascul:.	who isn't from canada?
Nov 14 02:50:08 .:phogg:.	rascul: weirdos
Nov 14 02:50:11 .:bmr:.	putin
Nov 14 02:50:13 .:xmppswiley:.	it's so weird that houses are expensive there. If you drive around almost the whole country is completely empty
Nov 14 02:50:20 .:bmr:.	putis is not allowed to be canadian
Nov 14 02:50:37 .:phogg:.	xmppswiley: the whole country isn't conveniently located near the shops and jobs
Nov 14 02:50:57 .:xmppswiley:.	You should see the US.
Nov 14 02:50:58 .:Sauvin:.	Welp, it's official. For the time being, Domino's is unavailable to people who cannot use a phone. This shuts out a great many deaf/hard of hearing people. I am one grumpy old man now.
Nov 14 02:51:07 .:hangint3n:.	housing is expensive here, and yes most of Canada is either empty boreal forest or tundra.
Nov 14 02:51:10 .:xmppswiley:.	People will work like an hour or two's drive from their house.
Nov 14 02:51:17 .:bmr:.	also, icehockeyrinks and curling
Nov 14 02:51:22 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: you contacted their support?
Nov 14 02:51:28 .:bmr:.	people who curl are always polite
Nov 14 02:51:35 .:bmr:.	!!
Nov 14 02:51:40 .:rascul:.	everybody uses curl
Nov 14 02:51:42 .:Sauvin:.	I tried. It hangs, too.
Nov 14 02:51:42 .:xmppswiley:.	There's sprawl in Canada but it's super minimal, everything almost just cuts off straight from urban to rural.
Nov 14 02:51:58 .:hangint3n:.	pretty much

Nov 14 02:59:14 .:hangint3n:.	bmr: am I going to regret watching this video?
Nov 14 02:59:15 .:Sauvin:.	Eh, they have some kind of "customer support chatbot", which also hangs.
Nov 14 02:59:21 .:phogg:.	konrados: the next easiest would be some modest shell scripting where you -exec a little shell script that fixes path issues for you
Nov 14 02:59:43 .:xmppswiley:.	I've found bugs on their site before
Nov 14 02:59:54 .:phogg:.	Sauvin: looked at your browser network panel? See any errors? Maybe there's a specific domain that's not communicating, or somethg
Nov 14 02:59:59 .:phogg:.	re, something
Nov 14 03:00:00 .:rascul:.	there's at least 80,000 bugs
Nov 14 03:00:00 .:xmppswiley:.	Around when I finally managed to kill my pizza addiction their tracker thing stopped working
Nov 14 03:00:16 .:Khaytsus:.	rascul: one bug per file?  That's not even sane :P
Nov 14 03:00:23 .:rascul:.	a php file is inherently a bug
Nov 14 03:00:26 .:bmr:.	this is dominoes.com isnt it
Nov 14 03:00:29 .:koollman_:.	konrados: cp isn't much of a backup. you could make a tar file, or use rsync, or some real backup software
Nov 14 03:00:31 .:konrados:.	phogg, thanks! bmr - I did make a backup of everything, but now I work on the code only :)
Nov 14 03:00:32 .:phogg:.	Khaytsus: using PHP generally counts as a bug by itself
Nov 14 03:00:40 .:bmr:.	or whatever that pizza-place is called
Nov 14 03:00:49 .:xmppswiley:.	I refuse to work on php

Nov 14 03:01:13 .:phogg:.	xmppswiley: modern PHP is really not that bad. If you held a gun to my head and demanded a choice between php8 and python3 I'd probably prefer php
Nov 14 03:01:48 .:phogg:.	xmppswiley: it has arrived at the point of being *mostly* usable, so long as you box *all* of your primitives (except bool, probably)
Nov 14 03:01:57 .:xmppswiley:.	The last time I did php stuff was when I was freelancing. The guy had like 12 incomplete copies of his site all over /var/www and there were half a dozen other freelancers sshed in moving stuff around

Nov 14 03:07:02 .:konrados:.	koollman_, correct, yes! :)
Nov 14 03:07:04 .:johnjaye:.	phogg: can i feed the output of this command to the printer and it will just work (TM)
Nov 14 03:07:07 .:johnjaye:.	i'm skeptical here
Nov 14 03:07:25 .:phogg:.	johnjaye: with HTML+CSS3 you can define a grid splitting the screen in half and put a div on either half, then the browser will flow within those divs
Nov 14 03:07:42 .:phogg:.	johnjaye: for plain text, sure you can.
Nov 14 03:08:03 .:phogg:.	johnjaye: might take a bit of research, but you used to be able to do little more than cat | lpr
Nov 14 03:08:17 .:phogg:.	not sure what the state of printing is like any more since I haven't owned a printer in a decade
Nov 14 03:09:44 .:phogg:.	johnjaye: for HTML try e.g. here https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/ and set columns to 2 and rows to 1, then click the "please may I have some code" button
Nov 14 03:12:42 .:hangint3n:.	Had to change my ram choice. The one I was going to order is not available so I'm going with this instead:
Nov 14 03:12:44 .:hangint3n:.	Kingston Fury Beast (Black) 64GB (2x32GB) DDR4 3600MT/s CL18 Dual Channel Memory Kit (KF436C18BBK2/64)

Nov 14 03:12:48 .:hangint3n:.	Sorry for that
Nov 14 03:13:05 .:mefistofeles:.	I wonder if anyone here has a framework laptop running Linux, how's the bttery life there? I see some issues in the forums but no estimate on how much you actually get from it.
Nov 14 03:13:09 .:xx:.	hangint3n: get one with ECC
Nov 14 03:13:10 .:hangint3n:.	don't know why weechat did that.
Nov 14 03:13:28 .:hangint3n:.	xx: why?
Nov 14 03:13:46 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: without ECC some amount if random errors will happen, then all bets are off
Nov 14 03:13:49 .:MockingMoniker:.	If I want to make a directory visible on the network readable/writable, but I don't want it to be "reliable" like NFS but rather sort of an application like, Samba, is Samba my best option or is there a better way?
Nov 14 03:13:57 .:mefistofeles:.	hangint3n: what is it for? If it isn't a server or some critical workstation, I'd think ECC is not needed
Nov 14 03:14:26 .:phogg:.	MockingMoniker: there are a lot of choices. Maybe syncthing, possibly diod (but access control can be a pain).
Nov 14 03:14:36 .:MockingMoniker:.	SMB has that,"if it works, it works," sort of design.
Nov 14 03:14:42 .:chris64:.	Does anybody happen to know if the kernel coalesces accesses on flash drives? i.e. when I ask the kernel to copy multiples of a block size to userland memory (using io_uring for example), will this be as efficient as if I would only request a single page?
Nov 14 03:15:00 .:phogg:.	MockingMoniker: who do you want to be able to access it? How should they be able to discover it? How do you want to control who can read and write?
Nov 14 03:15:13 .:hangint3n:.	This ram is just for a desktop... no gaming, no programming.
Nov 14 03:15:37 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: ECC is good for safety on any system, but you do pay a premium for that
Nov 14 03:15:53 .:MockingMoniker:.	phogg: this isn't for anything sensitive but I would like basic security (encryption not really necessary). What's more important is that I can just use it but it's not relied on like something critical will run. This is just to add files to a media box I'm building.
Nov 14 03:16:02 .:xmppswiley:.	ecc seems like overkill for a desktop.
Nov 14 03:16:13 .:MockingMoniker:.	phogg: just me, and if it doesn't work all of a sudden it's OK.
Nov 14 03:16:31 .:Khaytsus:.	A mobo has support ECC yes?
Nov 14 03:16:38 .:Khaytsus:.	Mobo and cpu iirc
Nov 14 03:17:05 .:xmppswiley:.	I didn't think the cpu needed to care.
Nov 14 03:17:41 .:phogg:.	MockingMoniker: why not use sshfs?
Nov 14 03:17:57 .:MockingMoniker:.	I'll take a look.
Nov 14 03:18:00 .:MockingMoniker:.	thanks, phogg.
Nov 14 03:18:18 .:phogg:.	MockingMoniker: I would just use NFS anyway, because it's easy and reliable. But sshfs is even simpler to understand.'
Nov 14 03:19:01 .:phogg:.	xmppswiley: ECC is never overkill. Not using ECC everywhere is borderline insane.
Nov 14 03:19:09 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: ECC is premium and a special order item... no refunds at the store I deal with.
Nov 14 03:20:58 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: I've run a lot of computers over the years and only one used ECC.  I've never run into a problem. I appreciate the opinion though.
Nov 14 03:21:24 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: sadly that is the perspective of most people, which is why ECC is still a premium item
Nov 14 03:21:52 .:phogg:.	the reality is that you've never *noticed* problems because you don't have anything checking and it hasn't been bad enough to break anything
Nov 14 03:22:16 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: probably true.
Nov 14 03:23:50 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: given how much time I actually spend compiling software you would think I would have had a problem a noticable problem by now? no?
Nov 14 03:25:28 .:phogg:.	hangint3n: it may be very hard to notice bit flips, depending on where they happen
Nov 14 03:26:32 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: that is also true.
Nov 14 03:26:59 .:phogg:.	could be that they happen and in some memory that isn't read again before it is overwritten. If you get lucky like that you may have errors often and never notice. Or, it may happen in something that gets read again, but the difference of that bit doesn't happen to change later. Very rarely will the result of a bit flip lead to anything *noticeably* wrong, like a crash
Nov 14 03:27:47 .:phogg:.	you could well have some file on disk with a single byte in it that has the wrong value due to corruption from RAM; unless and until something reads that and relies on it *and then does a wrong thing* you won't know it.
Nov 14 03:28:12 .:phogg:.	how many errors do all of us have? probably not a lot, but we don't know--and we don't know where--and that should scare everyone just a little
Nov 14 03:28:44 .:rascul:.	i have all the errors
Nov 14 03:28:56 .:phogg:.	greedy!
Nov 14 03:29:07 .:rascul:.	i error so you don't
Nov 14 03:32:58 .:hangint3n:.	rascul: LOL
Nov 14 03:37:06 .:MockingMoniker:.	So, I can't access any files in the directory mounted by sshfs. I used the same user (which has the same ID number on both systems) to mount a directory owned by another user (with ID 1001) but user 1000 has permissions (tested) to navigate into that directory, but from the remote system that mounted it with sshfs, I get a permissions error.
Nov 14 03:38:49 .:ayecee:.	ok
Nov 14 03:38:55 .:Sauvin:.	What are the permissions on the sshfs mountpoint?
Nov 14 03:39:33 »»	denis is now known as Guest4590
Nov 14 03:39:40 »»	Guest4590 is now known as denisgordeev
Nov 14 03:39:41 .:ayecee:.	the fact that it's the same id number on both systems is not important to sshfs
Nov 14 03:40:49 .:ayecee:.	on the remote system, you act as the user you logged in as. don't know if that has any bearing on your problem though.
Nov 14 03:43:22 .:Sauvin:.	So, of course, I'm a FireFox user. In case some incompatibility with it and the Domino's site has suddenly arisen, I decided to try the chromium browser, which I've discovered is not installed on my Kubuntu 20.04. So, I'm installing it. It's a snap, and THAT process is taking calendar time.
Nov 14 03:43:25 .:MockingMoniker:.	Nevermind, I pulled "default_permissions" and it works.
Nov 14 03:48:26 .:hangint3n:.	phogg: ECC has become moot, my mobo of choice doesn't support it... I'd have to go to a Pro or Workstation motherboard it think to get that support.
Nov 14 03:49:41 .:hangint3n:.	If I'm gonna make this upgrade I need to stay in the $700 window (plus ram).

Nov 14 15:01:31 .:djph:.	Czernobog: df? du?
Nov 14 15:01:46 .:hexnewbie:.	I guess Python got it because 1) it's useful for single numbers and bytes, and in calculators in general, 2) they were trying to be thorough with the binascii module

Nov 14 15:02:19 .:djph:.	Czernobog: uh, what?
Nov 14 15:02:44 .:Czernobog:.	I have 20gb vps and I want to use minimum storage possible. They offer Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9, 10

Nov 14 15:02:56 .:djph:.	Debian
Nov 14 15:03:16 .:Czernobog:.	they also have centOS 7 and centOS 8
Nov 14 15:03:38 .:djph:.	Depends on whether you're more familiar with Debian or RedHat
Nov 14 15:04:14 .:Czernobog:.	I am fine with both but I want something which uses the lowest space since I want to use the rest to store data

Nov 14 15:09:12 .:Czernobog:.	the rest will be storage and they will be emptied out frequently
Nov 14 15:10:14 .:Czernobog:.	I know i don't need docker for wireguard but I need docker for the other thing. I asked the developer and he said he himself is running it on docker on vps. Other than that there's gui which doesn't work on vps

Nov 15 01:08:39 .:yarrie:.	MrElendig: killed sync as in removed from chromium? or as in they forced it upon chromium? i'm out of the loop but remember something like forcing it upon ppl in chromium

Nov 15 01:19:47 .:MrElendig:.	I know they had an agreement with proton earlier, but I think they switched possibly?
Nov 15 01:19:51 .:frumious:.	you'll need DNS tunneled

Nov 15 01:21:16 .:xmppswiley:.	Passwords go in a password manager you back up to your desktop with rsync. Bookmarks go in bookmarks.html in git.

Nov 15 01:59:06 .:ayecee:.	pretty well actually
Nov 15 01:59:44 .:ayecee:.	however you'd normally get "operation not permitted" rather than "permission denied" if apparmor were blocking it, i think.
Nov 15 02:00:17 .:innominate:.	Hi, tell me if I've screwed up my system in some way - so, I had a directory in my /home folder that I installed something in, my user is located in /home too, and I need permissions to that folder, so I did sudo chown -R /home/THATFOLDERNAME, and I think I had a trailing space and dot after it, once I did that, I got my permission but everything I had connected to online connection closed...
Nov 15 02:00:19 .:innominate:.	...and can't get them to reconnect
Nov 15 02:00:40 .:ayecee:.	namei -l /opt/tpch/sf1/lineitem1.tbl would show you the permissions of the directories above the file as well.
Nov 15 02:01:10 .:ayecee:.	you've swcrewed up your system in some way
Nov 15 02:01:41 .:MrElendig:.	innominate: stat /
Nov 15 02:03:38 .:innominate:.	MrElendig: http://puu.sh/JrD80/05592f6f76.png
Nov 15 02:04:04 .:ayecee:.	that part is fine at least
Nov 15 02:04:06 .:MrElendig:.	at least its owned by root still
Nov 15 02:04:22 .:Bahhumbug:.	Depends where that command was run from.
Nov 15 02:04:33 .:innominate:.	Yeah, everything before home is still root, I checked via FTP WINSCP
Nov 15 02:04:56 .:Sauvin:.	FTP? WINSCP?
Nov 15 02:04:57 .:ayecee:.	doesn't really depend. something is screwed up.
Nov 15 02:05:29 .:Bahhumbug:.	It does depend if you want to know the actual extent of the problem and the resolution.
Nov 15 02:05:31 .:ayecee:.	the specific nature of the screw up is not yet apparent
Nov 15 02:05:45 .:ayecee:.	but the fact of the screw up is clear
Nov 15 02:05:57 .:Sauvin:.	On what OS is this?
Nov 15 02:06:04 .:ayecee:.	i bet it's linux
Nov 15 02:06:15 .:Sauvin:.	FTP? WINSCP?
Nov 15 02:06:25 .:ayecee:.	you keep saying that
Nov 15 02:06:30 .:ayecee:.	maybe add some more words
Nov 15 02:06:37 .:innominate:.	I used the trailing space and dot by mistake, what would that mean when using chown and -R recursive to own everything in a directory and sub directories?
Nov 15 02:06:39 .:Bahhumbug:.	...
Nov 15 02:06:39 .:Sauvin:.	Windows is involved, maybe. Might need more info.
Nov 15 02:06:57 .:ayecee:.	innominate: it would apply the chown to the current directory
Nov 15 02:07:26 .:innominate:.	The space and dot was fine then?
Nov 15 02:07:35 .:ayecee:.	fine in what way
Nov 15 02:07:40 .:innominate:.	Gotcha
Nov 15 02:07:51 .:Sauvin:.	On what OS is this, and how are these Windows things involved?
Nov 15 02:08:03 .:ayecee:.	Sauvin: windows is involved as a client.
Nov 15 02:08:12 .:Sauvin:.	What's the "host"?
Nov 15 02:08:26 .:ayecee:.	we're presuming linux in absence of evidence to the contrary
Nov 15 02:08:30 .:innominate:.	WinSCP to FTP and putty to SSH to it all from my Windows machine
Nov 15 02:08:46 .:Sauvin:.	innominate, but the server is Linux? Which variety?
Nov 15 02:08:57 .:innominate:.	Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS
Nov 15 02:09:07 .:innominate:.	Debian 11.1
Nov 15 02:09:12 .:innominate:.	Bullseye
Nov 15 02:09:19 »»	Sauvin breathes easier
Nov 15 02:09:26 .:ayecee:.	o_O
Nov 15 02:10:09 .:Sauvin:.	ayecee, we've had real go-arounds before where people didn't admit they were using OSX or something similarly silly.
Nov 15 02:10:42 .:ayecee:.	that ptsd acting up again huh
Nov 15 02:11:00 .:Sauvin:.	Yup!
Nov 15 02:11:28 .:Sauvin:.	Channel got ate up once for most of eight hours, I think, trying to help somebody with a grep problem, only the grep in question was on a Mac.
Nov 15 02:11:44 .:innominate:.	xD
Nov 15 02:11:50 .:ayecee:.	i swear that an hour gets added each time you tell that story
Nov 15 02:12:15 .:Sauvin:.	40 days and 40 nights, which is an ancient way of saying "Don't really know how long it was, but it was a REALLY long time!"
Nov 15 02:12:16 .:mefistofeles:.	ugh, zoom seems to have serious memory leaks in Linux
Nov 15 02:12:29 .:ayecee:.	innominate: so, the trailing space and the dot is fine if you were in a directory where you wanted that chown applied.
Nov 15 02:12:35 .:mefistofeles:.	after 23 hours, it was using almost 10GB of memory xD
Nov 15 02:12:46 .:innominate:.	So, one of my disconnected programs returned online - not sure why it al went down after the chown, I hope it was a temporary glitch
Nov 15 02:13:01 .:ayecee:.	would be nice eh
Nov 15 02:14:18 .:innominate:.	ayecee, when I applied chown, I was in my user but in the location of one of my programs that got knocked offline, maybe that's why, but that program came back up
Nov 15 02:15:04 .:ayecee:.	complete word salad. glad it's working for you  now.
Nov 15 02:26:00 .:Dagmar:.	mefistofeles: If you're stuck in a zoom call lasting 23 hours, it's time to get a knife and make some "staff cuts", yo.

Nov 15 02:35:34 .:hodapp:.	of course, when he blames that on "activists", that's more just stupidity than just business
Nov 15 02:37:00 .:Dagmar:.	Good god
Nov 15 02:37:08 .:circuitbone:.	They will be back after the show.
Nov 15 02:37:17 .:Dagmar:.	I just watched a video of a guy looking into the power connector issue on the 4xxx-series cards
Nov 15 02:37:24 .:Dagmar:.	Some vendor is going to get dropped
Nov 15 02:37:47 .:Dagmar:.	Literally the connector itself is hitting over 60C/140F
Nov 15 02:37:53 .:circuitbone:.	advertisers are not altruistic, whatever works, no matter the history. lol
Nov 15 02:37:53 .:MrElendig:.	Dagmar: history is repeating itself
Nov 15 02:37:59 .:Sauvin:.	The whole thing is a house of cards. Sooner or later, we'll discover that when it all falls down.
Nov 15 02:38:14 .:Sauvin:.	When it does, I wonder: will we have learned anything. I doubt.
Nov 15 02:38:22 .:Dagmar:.	Some parts supplier cut a corner there and decided to use one wire to feed two pins, which is umm... just as dumb as it sounds
Nov 15 02:38:23 .:MrElendig:.	Dagmar: its molex->pcie all over again
Nov 15 02:38:28 .:hodapp:.	circuitbone: he needs advertisers waaaay more than they need him

Nov 15 02:38:50 .:MrElendig:.	only with 600w instead of 150
Nov 15 02:38:54 .:circuitbone:.	I don't reply to irrational positions
Nov 15 02:39:04 .:Dagmar:.	Connectors under strain going up about ten degrees over ambient isn't _great_ but it's not horrifying
Nov 15 02:39:12 .:Dagmar:.	Something getting hot enough to burn you is a hard no
Nov 15 02:39:28 .:hodapp:.	circuitbone: that's not irrational at all; there's a reason advertisers left in droves, and it's just business
Nov 15 02:39:30 .:MrElendig:.	10C over ambi is pretty much nothing at these power levels
Nov 15 02:39:41 »»	circuitbone pops another one on the mute shelf
Nov 15 02:39:43 .:mrmber:.	I have a binary with apparmor that I got from another machine. I want to test it locally without the apparmor profiles. Is there any way to do this without patching the binary?
Nov 15 02:39:45 .:Dagmar:.	MrElendig: Yeah that's an "it's actually on" temperature
Nov 15 02:40:00 .:hodapp:.	circuitbone: holy cripes, you're as much of a snowflake as Elon Musk is, just a lot poorer
Nov 15 02:40:11 .:Dagmar:.	With what's going on they might as well be trying to run a hair dryer over a USB cable
Nov 15 02:40:34 .:MrElendig:.	Dagmar: available on aliexpress
Nov 15 02:40:46 .:MrElendig:.	also amazon
Nov 15 02:48:22 .:NyB:.	does nobody else see anything wrong with having a GPU that consumes half a kilowatt or power, on its own?
Nov 15 02:48:41 .:NyB:.	(I hope it's idle power is much much less, at least?)
Nov 15 02:49:29 .:MrElendig:.	average power is generally well below that
Nov 15 02:49:49 .:MrElendig:.	if you overclock it though..
Nov 15 02:50:00 .:NyB:.	MrElendig: yes, but it looks like there are games that push it up there consistently
Nov 15 02:50:37 .:Guest55:.	hey
Nov 15 02:51:03 .:Guest55:.	How can I find the Network Address with ifconfig or netsat
Nov 15 02:51:10 .:NyB:.	I don't know if there are optimizations that developers could do to not need that kind of GPU...
Nov 15 02:51:16 .:MrElendig:.	start by not using ifconfig nor netstat
Nov 15 02:51:23 .:Guest55:.	?
Nov 15 02:51:31 .:MrElendig:.	they have been deprecated for 20 years
Nov 15 02:51:45 .:MrElendig:.	Guest55: is this for human consumption or for a script?
Nov 15 02:51:52 .:Guest55:.	human
Nov 15 02:51:55 .:NyB:.	...but I have to question whether games should focus this much on visuals, instead of depth.

Nov 15 16:15:15 .:linuxfromscratch:.	I'm cross compiling gcc with gcc so I can code while I code
Nov 15 16:10:37 .:woland:.	understandable 
Nov 15 16:19:32 .:bigshot00:.	is it possible to block kernel from reading RTC value, at boot - so even if CMOS battery is not present, booting won't take extra time...?
Nov 15 16:19:55 .:wigums:.	lol
Nov 15 16:20:18 .:bigshot00:.	currently, i have to wait 1 or 2 minutes since CMOS battery is dead?
Nov 15 16:20:18 .:wigums:.	it takes like 5 seconds to set time during boot
Nov 15 16:20:40 .:wigums:.	what are you using to set time?
Nov 15 16:20:44 .:bigshot00:.	ntp
Nov 15 16:20:51 .:wigums:.	try chrony
Nov 15 16:21:10 .:wigums:.	it uses ntp
Nov 15 16:21:24 .:bigshot00:.	wigums: when i try to boot, kernel reads time from RTC, since it is not getting correct time, booting is delayed
Nov 15 16:21:38 .:bigshot00:.	that's what i think is happening
Nov 15 16:22:03 .:djph:.	bigshot00: the issue from RTC (or not at all) is that the first NTP transaction will take time no matter what (because of how NTP works)
Nov 15 16:22:07 .:wigums:.	right. try chrony
Nov 15 16:23:06 .:djph:.	I think chrony is one of the ones that can skip that initial "wait, why is it 30 years 11 months 2 days 9 hours in the future?!"
Nov 15 16:23:08 .:bigshot00:.	djph: ntp requires internet...
Nov 15 16:23:14 .:djph:.	bigshot00: indeed it does
Nov 15 16:23:17 .:bigshot00:.	cool
Nov 15 16:23:23 .:bigshot00:.	i am trying chrony
Nov 15 16:23:54 .:wigums:.	well yea just make sure it doesnt run until the net is up
Nov 15 16:38:27 .:Khaytsus:.	ntp does not technically require internet..  You can aquire it from other sources, such as GPS.
Nov 15 16:39:27 .:mlu:.	so I found out that my 2014 BMW apparently doesn't acquire time via GPS even though it has a GPS chip
Nov 15 16:39:57 .:Khaytsus:.	mlu: Actually, sometimes they do, but they only know UTC, not timezone.
Nov 15 16:40:05 .:Khaytsus:.	And don't calculate DST etc.
Nov 15 16:40:05 .:mlu:.	that was a huge disappointment -- but time change happened, noticed that the clock didn't update, and I played around a bit, just to find out that it was relying on a dead 3G signal :(
Nov 15 16:40:45 .:Khaytsus:.	My wifes vehicle updates the time.. if I set it wrong, it updates.  But it has no idea what the timezone is for some reason.  I guess so if DST rules change it won't be wrong.
Nov 15 16:41:00 .:mlu:.	it supposedly has an updated timezones file from 2018
Nov 15 16:41:13 .:mlu:.	but I was just a little "sad" -- it's annoying that the feature is there but implemented so poorly
Nov 15 16:41:42 .:mlu:.	I wonder if the 2G towers are still up
Nov 15 16:41:45 .:Khaytsus:.	I wonder if my car has GPS, I suspect it does even without satnav for the (long dead) SOS stuff.
Nov 15 16:41:57 .:Khaytsus:.	Sure, 2G towers are up.  the equpiment is LONG replaced :P
Nov 15 16:42:07 .:mlu:.	mines sure does and it just has a slightly outdated maps database
Nov 15 16:42:27 .:mlu:.	oh yeah, the 2G towers are now broadcasting 5G signals :)
Nov 15 16:42:28 .:bigshot00:.	wigums: if i remove option "Now and on Boot" sync ntp my nuc won't delay boot right?
Nov 15 16:42:39 .:bigshot00:.	chronyc and d are already installed in opensuse
Nov 15 16:43:01 .:mlu:.	it's funny how support for 2G hasn't really ever been dropped on most cell phones
Nov 15 16:43:06 .:Khaytsus:.	Some years ago they offered to upgrade my dead SOS stuff for a new one for like $800 + monthly fee, I was like lol no
Nov 15 16:43:17 .:mlu:.	BMW wants closer to $2100
Nov 15 16:43:28 .:Khaytsus:.	This was cheaper because it did have service previously.
Nov 15 16:44:07 .:mlu:.	lol no is right -- that's what I have my cell phone for, and if I was really going far, I'd probably take an inmarsat device too
Nov 15 16:44:39 .:Khaytsus:.	Ya know I don't get why cars don't have a cell modem built in, as long as it's a supported cell still, it can dial 911.
Nov 15 16:44:50 .:Khaytsus:.	No need for some silly ongoing service.
Nov 15 16:45:09 .:mlu:.	makes less money :)
Nov 15 16:45:13 .:Khaytsus:.	Yep
Nov 15 16:45:29 .:Khaytsus:.	I wonder, did ANYONE ever hit that button and ask how to get to the McDonalds?  No.
Nov 15 16:45:35 .:mlu:.	oooh, you know what else is funny: it turns out that the cell modem in my car actaully also has its own battery that's charged from 12V
Nov 15 16:46:13 .:Khaytsus:.	Huh, so in case you're in a wreck and the primary battery is damaged it still has power?
Nov 15 16:46:13 .:mlu:.	i.e. it's not just a step-down from the input or something -- there's an actual separate li-poly battery
Nov 15 16:46:26 .:mlu:.	heh, who knows -- I was very surprised to find it
Nov 15 16:46:41 .:Sauvin:.	2G is still a thing?
Nov 15 16:46:49 .:Khaytsus:.	Interesting, under the trunk floor?  I've poked around under there running some cables but never noticed anything except just "boxes"
Nov 15 16:47:08 .:mlu:.	Sauvin: that's what I'm wondering too -- apparently none of the consumer cellphones ever deprecated support
Nov 15 16:47:34 .:Sauvin:.	Do the different Gees require different hardware?
Nov 15 16:47:45 .:Khaytsus:.	Some carriers were still using some old stuff for voice not too long back.
Nov 15 16:48:14 .:mlu:.	Sauvin: I'd imagine -- it's different bands
Nov 15 16:48:25 .:Sauvin:.	Ah, *bands*, didn't know that.
Nov 15 16:48:30 .:mlu:.	maybe they were like: heh, it's all on a single antenna anyways
Nov 15 16:48:51 .:Khaytsus:.	mlu: So just like all lihtium batteries, that battery will go preggers...  Hopefully they have some way to know that and stop charging it?
Nov 15 16:49:10 .:mlu:.	Khaytsus: fingers crossed
Nov 15 16:49:22 .:Sauvin:.	Speaking of which, where the hell did I put MY phone?

Nov 15 16:50:26 .:mlu:.	my main thought this entire time: wtf -- they could have done so much better -- I just wish I had a way to have my cell phone use the cellular antenna in the car or something
Nov 15 16:50:49 .:bigshot00:.	wigums: what conf changes should i do to chrony so that pc doesn't check for time during boot...
Nov 15 16:50:50 .:Khaytsus:.	mlu: Yeah, I'll have to look again in mine..  Is it obvious?  I've only just noticed boxes in there of whatever..  AFAIK the radio and some stuff is under there.
Nov 15 16:51:07 .:Khaytsus:.	Not sure I've ever actually looked at them closely
Nov 15 16:51:35 .:Khaytsus:.	I ran some power off the battery for a ham radio and that's about the only time I've been under that trunk floor
Nov 15 16:51:42 .:mlu:.	Khaytsus: yeah, quite obvious -- it's on the underside of the communications module
Nov 15 16:51:44 .:dkfke:.	how can I map the module names to the module filenames?
Nov 15 16:51:53 .:mlu:.	Khaytsus: you will see an obvious battery pillow in there
Nov 15 16:52:09 .:mlu:.	it's next to the rear fuse box
Nov 15 16:52:11 .:Khaytsus:.	mlu: Did you remove stuff or just obviously it
Nov 15 16:52:21 .:wigums:.	bigshot00 i honestly dont know. i can tell you how to do it on slackware with sysV init and thats about it
Nov 15 16:52:31 .:mlu:.	I did partially uninstall the comm module and then reinstalled it
Nov 15 16:52:39 .:Khaytsus:.	mlu: I have a 2011 128i btw..  They all vary, but I am curious and I'll peep.
Nov 15 16:52:41 .:wigums:.	i dont know systemD and all that

Nov 15 16:55:43 .:bigshot00:.	that's it?
Nov 15 16:55:50 .:bigshot00:.	after network is up right?
Nov 15 16:56:11 .:wigums:.	yes. just make sure chrony runs AFTER the net gets brought up and youll be fine
Nov 15 16:56:32 .:bigshot00:.	wigums: how would you check for that on your system?
Nov 15 16:56:41 .:bigshot00:.	what is there is no network?
Nov 15 16:56:43 .:bigshot00:.	 will it hang?
Nov 15 16:56:58 .:wigums:.	yea for a minute maybe it will hang

Nov 15 17:07:58 .:BluesKaj:.	Hi all
Nov 15 17:08:23 .:bigshot00:.	hey BluesKaj
Nov 15 17:08:39 .:kurahaupo:.	bigshot00: Continuous synchronisation is almost always preferable; it minimises clock slew rate
Nov 15 17:08:56 .:BluesKaj:.	hey bigshot00
Nov 15 17:10:13 .:bigshot00:.	kurahaupo: my CMOS battery is weak - it is causes booting process to slow down that's why if i use the option of "sync w/o deamon" - that error won't come right during boot?
Nov 15 17:10:40 .:ananke:.	seems like replacing battery would be ideal
Nov 15 17:10:50 .:jadenlian:.	i have this vm running windows 10  but for some reason  i cant ping the host nor the host ping the guest  and the network setting its set to bridged i try two different routers and i even tried the hotspot on my cel  any ideas what could i be missing

Nov 15 23:09:10 .:Intelo:.	One thing I forgot is that host linux has BTRFS and guest FreeBSD has ZFS, So two COWs (copy on write) might be an issue?
Nov 15 23:09:16 .:Intelo:.	larsm
Nov 15 23:11:06 .:jensen:.	i have 2x drives mirrored on desktop and going to make them single and move one of them back to external hdd. they are same model. can i assume sda/sdb/sdc corresponds to sata 1/2/3 ?
Nov 15 23:12:04 .:larsm:.	Intelo: that is honestly something i haven't thought about yet. i have used a btrfs linux vm on macos, which uses apfs, also a cow fs, and not noticed any issues, though that might not be saying a lot
Nov 15 23:12:46 .:Intelo:.	larsm talking to #btrfs guys will benefit you
Nov 15 23:12:57 .:Intelo:.	or zfs guys
Nov 15 23:13:20 .:larsm:.	i am sure, they must be smarter than me :)
Nov 15 23:13:45 .:Dagmar:.	Intelo: Usually the "worst case" for virtualization is about 10-15% overhead, but that drops _quite_ a bit using virt* devices

Nov 15 23:18:14 .:hodapp:.	neoncortex: you can go even further and do some network simulation with tun/tap devices
Nov 15 23:18:31 .:neoncortex:.	Dagmar: Yeah, maybe I should consider virt-manager.
Nov 15 23:18:46 .:neoncortex:.	hodapp: That, too.
Nov 15 23:19:05 .:hodapp:.	and Linux has - I think - things that behave like virtual switches there too, though I forget the name
Nov 15 23:19:12 .:Dagmar:.	Bridges
Nov 15 23:19:28 .:Dagmar:.	They even do STP
Nov 15 23:19:33 .:Dagmar:.	...and lldp I think
Nov 15 23:19:52 .:jim:.	neoncortex, virt-manager is linked against libvirt, and things linked against that lib usually use qemu and kvn
Nov 15 23:20:02 .:Dagmar:.	True
Nov 15 23:20:18 .:Dagmar:.	...but virt-manager abstracts all the fiddly bits away in a nice GUI
Nov 15 23:20:36 .:neoncortex:.	I have to look, I just installed qemu, from sources.  I do not know if I have to thinker with it to get libvirt to work.
Nov 15 23:20:42 .:Dagmar:.	If you want to plug a vm into a bridge, you just add a virtual NIC and tell it which bridge to attach the thing to
Nov 15 23:20:50 .:tusko:.	I am having many errors with lightdm. I just resumed my computer and logged in but got a black screen with a cursor. What do I even do there?
Nov 15 23:21:15 .:tusko:.	I dropped to a tty and looked at lightdm Xorg logs, but nothing stood out (except no plymouth)
Nov 15 23:21:28 .:tusko:.	I'm told Plymouth is a car or a type of herring fish
Nov 15 23:22:22 .:Dagmar:.	plymouth should be _long_ gone by that stage
Nov 15 23:22:23 .:jim:.	Dagmar, I'd argue that even in the gui, the settings involved were fiddly
Nov 15 23:22:42 .:Dagmar:.	I may have tweaked mine a bit more than yours
Nov 15 23:23:28 .:Dagmar:.	I know I generally diddle the config enough so that the default network it selects for virtuals is the bridge I have the specifc interface I want all the VMs on as a member
Nov 15 23:23:35 .:jim:.	you're saying you have a good amount of practice?
Nov 15 23:24:07 .:Dagmar:.	I do _most_ of my work in VMs
Nov 15 23:24:24 .:Dagmar:.	Like, I trust CentOS way more than I trust any vendor's iDRAC or iLO
Nov 15 23:24:26 .:tusko:.	Could not run plymouth --ping: Failed to execute a child process *plymouth* (No such file or diectory)
Nov 15 23:24:30 .:tusko:.	in the lightdm logs
Nov 15 23:24:50 .:tusko:.	I think that's not the problem though. I don't even know what plymouth is or if I should have it
Nov 15 23:25:30 .:Dagmar:.	jim: It's practically a given that if you give me a machine with more than four cores, I'm _going_ to install a minimal hypervisor config, set up most of the disk under a second LVM pool, and jsut virtualize everything from there
Nov 15 23:25:46 .:Dagmar:.	jim: Total code exposure for the host amounts to "ssh"
Nov 15 23:26:01 .:kfrench:.	Noone has ever used the words iLO and trust in the same sentence before.
Nov 15 23:26:24 .:Dagmar:.	kfrench: Dude, truly.  I actually used the _exploit_ to patch about a dozen machines a few years ago
Nov 15 23:26:55 .:Sauvin:.	what are iDRAC and iLO?
Nov 15 23:27:04 .:kfrench:.	Back in the day, a remove nt4 server locked up on me.  I sent it the ping-of-death, and all was well with the world
Nov 15 23:27:44 .:Dagmar:.	jim: I'm looking at the dialog for adding a NIC to a virt under virt-manager right now and there's exactly three things to diddle.  Network source (which says "Bridge bro: Host device vnet0"), the MAC address, and Device model (which I just leave at the hypervisor default setting)
Nov 15 23:27:57 .:kfrench:.	Sauvin: They are essentially separate computers built into dell and HP servers.  They are active if the power cord is plugged in, but the server is "off".  You can use ilo to power on/off the machine and check the status of hardware bits.
Nov 15 23:27:59 .:Dagmar:.	jim: If I click 'finish' then boom it's done
Nov 15 23:28:28 .:kfrench:.	Sauvin: I.e. OOB managmenet
Nov 15 23:28:30 .:Dagmar:.	Sauvin: They're little parasitic daughter systems that live inside expensive rackmount equipment to provide privileged access to host memory and disk for red-teamers
Nov 15 23:28:41 .:kfrench:.	Man, my spelling is wobblier today than normal.
Nov 15 23:28:56 .:Dagmar:.	Yes you mis-spelled "NOOB"
Nov 15 23:29:09 .:Sauvin:.	kfrench, most people have woobly spelling here. Join the club!
Nov 15 23:29:25 .:kfrench:.	Sauvin: I'm not just a member.  I'm the president.
Nov 15 23:29:37 .:Dagmar:.	Sauvin: The general idea is that they'll let an admin have the equivalent of physical console access to restore the machine to a useable state even if the host operating system has crashed hard or isn't even installed
Nov 15 23:29:37 .:Sauvin:.	What's a red-teamer?
Nov 15 23:29:45 .:Dagmar:.	Someone paid to f**k up your netwokr
Nov 15 23:29:50 .:Sauvin:.	Hee
Nov 15 23:29:56 .:kfrench:.	In pen-testing, you have the red team and the blue team.  The blue team is defense and red is offense.
Nov 15 23:29:58 .:johnjaye:.	yes who watches the watchers, but for servers
Nov 15 23:30:08 .:Intelo:.	Dagmar ok
Nov 15 23:30:08 .:Dagmar:.	...but if you connect an iLO/iDRAC port to anything that's not a strictly controlled "admin only" network, you are begging for problems
Nov 15 23:30:10 .:Intelo:.	good
Nov 15 23:30:15 .:Intelo:.	thanks
Nov 15 23:30:25 .:Sauvin:.	If I understand you properly, that sounds... potentially handy.
Nov 15 23:30:36 .:kfrench:.	Sauvin: ...when it works
Nov 15 23:30:45 .:johnjaye:.	is this the same as the baseboard management controller or BMC?
Nov 15 23:30:47 .:Dagmar:.	One of the vulns was literally that if you sent it a command and simply _didn't_ supply a password, it would accept it
Nov 15 23:31:11 .:Sauvin:.	!!
Nov 15 23:31:14 .:Dagmar:.	johnjaye: Somewhat
Nov 15 23:31:39 .:johnjaye:.	i read a networking book that was really going on and on about them
Nov 15 23:31:57 .:Dagmar:.	Having that stuff beats going down to the machine room and connecting a bunch of cables
Nov 15 23:31:58 .:johnjaye:.	how you gotta keep the right version of java around and you got to redirect the serial port so you can reboot it remotely etc
Nov 15 23:32:37 .:Dagmar:.	...but on the other hand they typically have very poor logging, and you can literally browse host memory
Nov 15 23:32:46 .:kfrench:.	johnjaye: When the iLo "client" was java, I spent _way_ more time keeping a working java around than I did actually using iLo.
Nov 15 23:33:15 .:Dagmar:.	...and since the vendors all think their customers can't go elsewhere easily, they tend to be pretty slack about updates or even telling customers they need an update
Nov 15 23:33:15 »»	Sauvin is bewoobled
Nov 15 23:33:43 .:Dagmar:.	...which is why I'll just use an ssh tunnel to the libvirt socket and virt-manager
Nov 15 23:33:53 .:kfrench:.	Sauvin: You couldn't use a java newer than vXYZ.  But vXYZ had timebombs in it so that it forced you to get a newer java.
Nov 15 23:34:15 .:johnjaye:.	virt-manager is only for vms though. what about a physical server
Nov 15 23:34:17 .:hodapp:.	tracking down some library issues... LD_DEBUG=libs is showing me things like "search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache", "trying file=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn.so.8" - which succeeds, even though that's not a real file. 'ldconfig -p' shows something like this - but with /usr prepended.
Nov 15 23:34:30 .:Dagmar:.	I just wish there was a way to segment rights a bit more there so I could grant access to _only_ the console
Nov 15 23:34:31 .:hodapp:.	what's the meaning of these /lib paths? how are they resolved, if not as filesystem paths?
Nov 15 23:34:35 .:ananke:.	what, you weren't the only one having additional VMs on your laptop/desktop to run the required java? amateur hour!
Nov 15 23:34:59 .:Sauvin:.	hodapp, what makes you think there's only one possible PATH?
Nov 15 23:35:01 .:Dagmar:.	ananke: That's actually kinda what led me to using an exploit to update some machines
Nov 15 23:35:16 .:hodapp:.	Sauvin: I don't know what you're asking.
Nov 15 23:35:55 .:kiflalover:.	old dualboot. options are in /boot/EFI where i have windows and pop. I recal i followed a guide that creates an extra partion on the flashdrive for configuring the dualboot. What might that be?
Nov 15 23:36:11 .:Sauvin:.	hodapp, my environment variables includes one for paths to shared objects and another for paths to perl modules.
Nov 15 23:36:24 .:white_magic:.	Hi, can someone recommend a way to port scan my own linux VPS? It's on one of the popular providers (e.g. Linode). Between UFW, Docker, and iptables, I think it's likely that I've overlooked some things. But I don't want my own VPS provider to block my home IP address.
Nov 15 23:36:42 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: Dont?
Nov 15 23:36:52 .:hodapp:.	Sauvin: I'm really not sure how that's relevant to what LD_DEBUG is showing me
Nov 15 23:36:53 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: but that would give me piece of mind?
Nov 15 23:36:59 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: If you run it, ss or netstat will happily tell you about every process currently listening for connections on a port
Nov 15 23:37:13 .:Dagmar:.	`netstat -tunap | grep LISTEN` for example
Nov 15 23:37:47 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: so that will also show me which ports are externally accessible?
Nov 15 23:37:58 .:white_magic:.	bc I know that Docker, for example, goes around UFW
Nov 15 23:38:07 .:Sauvin:.	LD_DEBUG shows paths to various things, yes?
Nov 15 23:38:31 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: It will show you what processes are listening for connections on any ports.
Nov 15 23:38:37 .:kiflalover:.	white_magic: how can Docker circumvent the firewall?
Nov 15 23:38:49 .:hodapp:.	Sauvin: it shows the search paths it's using for libraries
Nov 15 23:38:58 .:white_magic:.	kiflalover: i didn't say it circumvents "The Firewall (TM)", just UFW
Nov 15 23:39:01 .:Sauvin:.	Yup. What's the confusion?
Nov 15 23:39:17 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: To spell it out for you, you might have some firewall rules blocking other ports, but you can not have things listening for network connections that ss/netstat _won't_ see
Nov 15 23:39:17 .:white_magic:.	kiflalover: i'll just admit it, I'm scared of iptables
Nov 15 23:39:19 .:lv426res:.	white_magic: no one will block you for using  nmap -sT
Nov 15 23:39:20 .:white_magic:.	There, I have outed myself
Nov 15 23:39:37 .:rascul:.	then just use ufw
Nov 15 23:39:45 .:kiflalover:.	white_magic: open your ports. exposure therapy
Nov 15 23:39:50 .:white_magic:.	rascul: but Docker doesn't care if I use UFW
Nov 15 23:40:10 .:rascul:.	no, it doesn't
Nov 15 23:40:12 .:white_magic:.	rascul: granted, I know how to force docker to use 127.0.0.1 and not 0.0.0.0
Nov 15 23:40:16 .:rascul:.	but you can still use ufw yourself
Nov 15 23:40:22 .:white_magic:.	rascul: just concerned that i overlooked something
Nov 15 23:40:35 .:kiflalover:.	white_magic: does that include firewalld?
Nov 15 23:40:43 .:rascul:.	nmap to do port scan
Nov 15 23:40:43 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: thanks - i'll get comfy with ss/netstat!
Nov 15 23:40:57 .:white_magic:.	kiflalover: I don't know what firewalld is :(
Nov 15 23:40:59 .:rascul:.	'ss -tulnp' as root
Nov 15 23:41:07 .:white_magic:.	thx rascul
Nov 15 23:41:17 .:Dagmar:.	nmap is a thing you'd use to _double check_ that your combined configuration of all firewalling _and_ the murdering of unnecessary services is working
Nov 15 23:41:33 .:Dagmar:.	...or something you'd use on other people's sytems.
Nov 15 23:41:42 .:Dagmar:.	It's not optimal when you actually are the legit owner
Nov 15 23:42:13 .:hodapp:.	Sauvin: the fact that for "trying file=" and the subsequent "calling init: " it is regularly listing paths in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ that aren't valid, and the context of the loading (it lists the search path) does not suggest anything about this being relative to some search path
Nov 15 23:42:20 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: firewalld is a much simpler interface for describing firewall rules
Nov 15 23:42:30 .:hodapp:.	as it follows "search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache" typically
Nov 15 23:42:30 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: It still generates iptables rules for you
Nov 15 23:42:56 .:Dagmar:.	white_magic: `firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=https` should be pretty self-explanatory as examples go
Nov 15 23:43:09 .:hodapp:.	hence my original question: how are these paths being interpreted?
Nov 15 23:44:34 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: is firewalld newer than UFW?
Nov 15 23:44:36 .:kiflalover:.	white_magic: seems that docker use the ports if the firewall i not configured to block docker.
Nov 15 23:44:49 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: just asking to gauge the popularity of firewalld
Nov 15 23:45:15 .:kiflalover:.	white_magic: from my perspective its a matter of using RHEL or Debian

Nov 15 23:46:05 .:Sauvin:.	hodapp, not something I'd ever thought to question. The shell goes through $PATH, and looks to me like something in the system maintains some kind of list of directories to look into for shared objects. Poking at that right now.

Nov 15 23:48:43 .:Sauvin:.	This is partly why I don't know anything about it and am looking. The only time I've ever had problems with shared objects is when I install stuff manually.

Nov 15 23:49:36 .:Dagmar:.	Well who's idea was that?
Nov 15 23:49:52 .:hodapp:.	90% of the time I have problems with shared objects it's because of CUDA
Nov 15 23:49:52 .:rascul:.	white_magic might best to switch to ss, many distros don't include netstat anymore

Nov 15 23:51:50 .:rascul:.	sure, i don't know all of them though

Nov 15 23:54:55 .:Sauvin:.	hodapp, maybe something here will ring a bell for you (and hopefully you're better caffeinated than I): https://linux.die.net/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html
Nov 15 23:56:37 .:Sauvin:.	I'm assuming that when you "USE SHARED OBJECT 'somecrap' AS 'somealias'" in (some language), it calls out to some kind of shared object broker. I'm having trouble finding anything that looks something like this.
Nov 15 23:57:37 .:Dagmar:.	rascul: If they can't manage 1% market share they're not exactly a major distribution
Nov 15 23:58:24 .:rascul:.	i doubt that, for example, either suse or arch are as low as 1% market share
Nov 15 23:59:29 .:rascul:.	not sure how we could ever know for sure though
Nov 15 23:59:34 .:Dagmar:.	In production environments?
Nov 15 23:59:57 .:rascul:.	that wasn't an original constraint
Nov 15 23:59:57 .:Dagmar:.	I can just imagine a datacenter specializing in Arch
Nov 16 00:00:10 .:rascul:.	there are a large number of arch production systems i've seen, though
Nov 16 00:00:18 .:Dagmar:.	They'd either be a single-story facility or have some major fencing on the roof to prevent jumpers
Nov 16 00:00:46 .:rascul:.	there have been datacenters running on gentoo in the past also, but i haven't heard of that for over a decade
Nov 16 00:02:39 .:white_magic:.	Dagmar: perhaps in Schenzen. Maybe Foxconn can start a datacenter.
Nov 16 00:02:49 .:white_magic:.	They have those nets you're talking about
Nov 16 00:05:29 .:Sauvin:.	I can't even get arch installed in a VM. Yeah, a whole DC running Arch. Sheeee yit.
Nov 16 00:06:06 .:mefistofeles:.	Sauvin: what's the problem?
Nov 16 00:07:03 .:Sauvin:.	Not enough real knowledge about how a Linux system works. I couldn't get the network thing running.
Nov 16 00:07:19 .:rascul:.	did you try a sledgehammer?
Nov 16 00:07:45 .:rascul:.	i find that using a sledgehammer on a computer makes the problem go away
Nov 16 00:07:49 .:Sauvin:.	I did what any self-respecting old fart would do. I zapped the VM.
Nov 16 00:08:39 .:Sauvin:.	And from that experience I concluded that arch ain't for people who don't have the time or desire to study the structures involved.
Nov 16 00:08:55 .:rascul:.	gentoo can be installed in three commands
Nov 16 00:09:08 .:rascul:.	http://www.bash.org/?464385
Nov 16 00:09:12 .:Sauvin:.	And I'll bet I'd have the same problems with it.
Nov 16 00:09:17 .:hodapp:.	Sauvin: I did have that time, and decided it was an incredible waste of it. I quit using it after 3-4 years after being sick of the random breakage.
Nov 16 00:09:42 .:Sauvin:.	And thus, Dagmar's anti-jumper fences.
Nov 16 00:09:50 .:hodapp:.	there's plenty else that is worth learning, and in Linux too
Nov 16 00:10:04 .:rascul:.	i've heard that arch doesn't break as much nowadays
Nov 16 00:10:10 .:rascul:.	but i wouldn't actually know
Nov 16 00:10:11 .:geirha:.	that's 22 commands
Nov 16 00:10:33 .:Sauvin:.	22 commands?
Nov 16 00:10:45 .:rascul:.	it's just a single compound command
Nov 16 00:11:21 .:geirha:.	21 commands terminated by &&, plus one at the end
Nov 16 00:11:53 .:LunaLovegood:.	wouldn't actually work, the first command needs user interaction, then a few steps ater it tries to chroot into an empty directory.
Nov 16 00:12:41 .:rascul:.	interactivity wouldn't make it not work
Nov 16 00:12:51 .:rascul:.	but yeah it does want to chroot to an empty directory
Nov 16 00:13:16 .:geirha:.	printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/sh' 'script' 'here'...  > file && chmod +x file && ./file   that's three, so technically, they're right
Nov 16 00:18:28 .:hexnewbie:.	bash -c 'command to generate script goes here' # everything in just one command!
Nov 16 00:21:46 .:geirha:.	golf master!
Nov 16 00:22:02 .:geirha:.	though it could potentially hit ARG_MAX
Nov 16 00:22:34 .:LunaLovegood:.	curl https://whatever.com/installgentoo.sh | /bin/sh
Nov 16 00:23:50 .:hexnewbie:.	It's got to be an automated solution, which installs into /gentoo, moves /* into /old/, then /gentoo into /, installs bootloaders and reboots. 😜
Nov 16 00:25:10 .:hexnewbie:.	I had an idea on how to do that with Windows 9x, too (including parsing colour scheme, importing it into KDE, moving all apps into a Wine prefix, etc.), but newer Windows systems are too foreign to me to imagine it.
Nov 16 00:25:21 .:Dagmar:.	Yes, that's a _grand_ thing to automate
Nov 16 00:25:40 .:Dagmar:.	I approve heartily of the results such a set of commands will achieve.
Nov 16 00:26:12 .:rascul:.	just do it
Nov 16 00:26:13 .:Dagmar:.	(Yes my approval can be considered very suspicious)
Nov 16 00:26:25 .:hexnewbie:.	It's like a ransomware you willing run and causes a different type of damage
Nov 16 00:26:33 .:LunaLovegood:.	For windows you might as well make it a .exe
Nov 16 00:26:39 .:hexnewbie:.	willingly
Nov 16 00:26:40 .:Dagmar:.	ahem
Nov 16 00:26:57 .:geirha:.	I'll make one and be sure to credit you. # Dagmar whole heartedly approves of this script
Nov 16 00:26:58 .:Dagmar:.	hexnewbie: Think very carefully.  What'll happen when you move /* into /old
Nov 16 00:27:18 .:ayecee:.	a divide by zero error and the end of the universe as we know it
Nov 16 00:27:33 .:Dagmar:.	This is an honest mistake people make all the time until they learn an instinctive _fear_ of "/*"
Nov 16 00:27:58 .:ayecee:.	so many universes ended prematurely
Nov 16 00:28:19 .:geirha:.	just add /old/usr/bin to PATH first and it'll be fiiiine
Nov 16 00:28:19 .:hexnewbie:.	Dagmar: The only thing I can come up at the top of my head is that /proc/kcore will fill up /old
Nov 16 00:28:41 .:Dagmar:.	hexnewbie: Where will /gentoo be after that?
Nov 16 00:28:51 .:ayecee:.	the command will error out saying that it can't move /old into /old
Nov 16 00:29:12 .:hexnewbie:.	ayecee: It will move everything else successfully-ish
Nov 16 00:29:29 .:geirha:.	slap on 2>/dev/null and there's no problem
Nov 16 00:29:41 .:neoncortex:.	You get some quircks as you go.  I fear rm -r, so, first I write rm /path/to/whatever, then, after I'm sure the path is right, I go back and add the -r xD
Nov 16 00:30:01 .:Dagmar:.	neoncortex: I use ls. ;)
Nov 16 00:30:10 .:neoncortex:.	heh
Nov 16 00:30:10 .:ayecee:.	2>/dev/null is the software equivalent of the fabled Somebody Else's Problem field
Nov 16 00:30:31 .:hexnewbie:.	Dagmar: Yes. I even have a distant memory of having to deal with that once when I swapping distros (though I'm not completely sure I've ever swapped them without a spare partition)
Nov 16 00:30:50 .:Dagmar:.	Like the _second_ day I had my first nailed up machine running, I was trying to copy /home to it's own disk, and did cp -a .??* /home or something equally daft
Nov 16 00:31:03 .:hexnewbie:.	THe funnier part will be when it moves /home which is in a separate mountpoint, to the root filesystem
Nov 16 00:31:08 .:Dagmar:.	Totally forgetting that .??* also matches ..
Nov 16 00:31:45 .:Dagmar:.	It took a _damn while_ and a few moments to realize how the new disk was completely full
Nov 16 00:32:17 .:Dagmar:.	Actualyl maybe it was .?*
Nov 16 00:32:29 .:Dagmar:.	Either way I don't mess around with recursion and wildcards anymore, ever
Nov 16 00:32:45 .:rascul:.	i vaguely recall seeing a very unsupported method of installing gentoo over your running distro
Nov 16 00:33:31 .:hexnewbie:.	I wonder is there *any* useful code that relies on .* matching . and .. - if one were to break backward compatibility with it, would anything actually break
Nov 16 00:33:36 .:Dagmar:.	rascul: Usually they involve building a ramdisk and cloning the entire installation environment into it, and then burning the rest of the processes to the ground while it replaces the stored filesystem
Nov 16 00:34:37 .:Dagmar:.	Once you've ensured the original OS won't be trying to write to the disk anymore, and that your "suspended from the ceiling" environment won't explode, you can do whatever you like
Nov 16 00:34:44 .:Dagmar:.	...but you'd better get it done before the power blinks
Nov 16 00:35:53 .:hexnewbie:.	I've swapped a server either from Gentoo to Debian, or from Slackware to Gentoo, which was in a room I didn't have a key for, so I improvised. I unfortunately have no recollection how to share bad ideas :/
Nov 16 00:36:10 .:ayecee:.	probably better that way
Nov 16 00:36:12 .:rascul:.	oh no it was lfs not gentoo   https://linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/OLD/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt
Nov 16 00:36:38 .:Dagmar:.	Consdering LFS starts with a chrooted build environment they're most of hte way there already
Nov 16 00:36:40 .:rascul:.	oh here's a more up to date one   https://linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt
Nov 16 00:36:52 .:binaryhermit:.	that sounds really freaking dumb in a "hold my beer" way
Nov 16 00:36:56 .:Dagmar:.	If you're using LVM it gets even easier
Nov 16 00:37:17 .:Dagmar:.	binaryhermit: It kinda is, but it's been done at the enterprise level before
Nov 16 00:37:26 .:hexnewbie:.	Well, I did both those swaps like that (once I even had to convert a Linux iSCSI server to a FreeBSD iSCSI server with a single reboot, identical config and 5 minute downtime for the VMs on it), but one of those two Gentoo ones was done in particularly risky and untested way
Nov 16 00:37:26 .:sumthing1980:.	in ansi codes there is ESC[=18h	640 x 480 color (16-color graphics)
Nov 16 00:37:34 .:Dagmar:.	It comes down to "do you know your s**t or not?" basically
Nov 16 00:38:01 .:sumthing1980:.	do people have this kind of graphics in terminal?
Nov 16 00:38:08 .:Dagmar:.	If you make _one_ mistake, the box is basically not booting up again without install media
Nov 16 00:38:31 .:Dagmar:.	Way safer to install to a different set of logical volumes and just boot with different parameters
Nov 16 00:38:55 .:sumthing1980:.	or is it like ansi graphics of oldschool
Nov 16 00:38:57 .:hexnewbie:.	One thing I've noticed is that I had more successfully booting machines after crazy experiments when I was young than I do these days with a correctly and carefully done upgrade/modifcation.
Nov 16 00:39:07 .:Dagmar:.	...which is of course why you also wipe the partiiton table and repartition as LVM from your "flying ramdisk"
Nov 16 00:39:13 .:NyB:.	it does not even have to be a mistake. All it needs is a misplaced power outage :-)
Nov 16 00:39:41 .:Dagmar:.	NyB: Oh yeah I'm still fondly remembering the guy in here one night asking about how long a partition move should take
Nov 16 00:40:05 .:Dagmar:.	NyB: He was looking at a good 10+ hours, no UPS, and there were electrical storms coming
Nov 16 00:40:09 .:rascul:.	i remember someone concerned about dust in the ide cables
Nov 16 00:40:14 .:hexnewbie:.	“You should have used LVM” is such a mean yet correct answer to that :/
Nov 16 00:40:16 .:Dagmar:.	"Prayer, bro."
Nov 16 00:40:29 .:rascul:.	lvm is good stuff
Nov 16 00:41:27 .:hexnewbie:.	I wonder how well ‘block lvmify’ works. Yes, it can wreak havoc in your boot process, but at least your data is one restore of the partition table away.
Nov 16 00:41:28 .:rascul:.	llvm is pretty good too, it's like lvm but with an extra l

Nov 16 00:42:05 .:NyB:.	hexnewbie: reminds me of that (now unsupported IIRC) ext4->btrfs conversion thing
Nov 16 00:42:17 .:hexnewbie:.	NyB: That's particularly safe I think
Nov 16 00:42:27 .:rascul:.	oh i remember that thing
Nov 16 00:42:31 .:rascul:.	i think i did it once back in the day
Nov 16 00:43:05 .:rascul:.	https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-convert.html
Nov 16 00:43:09 .:Dagmar:.	We _do_ tell people over and over to use LVM
Nov 16 00:43:10 .:hexnewbie:.	NyB: I'm more excited about fstransform which converts any filesystem to any filesystem in place (with some warnings not to use it for NTFS)
Nov 16 00:43:16 .:Dagmar:.	If they suffer because they didn't, that's on them
Nov 16 00:43:28 .:Dagmar:.	s/it for//
Nov 16 00:43:33 .:ayecee:.	seems to be still supported
Nov 16 00:43:50 .:ayecee:.	huh, it does ntfs too? cool.
Nov 16 00:44:01 .:NyB:.	yeah, I thought the support had been dropped, but it's still tehre
Nov 16 00:45:11 .:hexnewbie:.	ayecee: Well, no. The fstransform tool is fs-agnostic, so if you call it on NTFS it will try to do something (unless it has child protection). But will likely cause damage. Author says there are some features towards safe conversion in the future.
Nov 16 00:45:27 .:ayecee:.	hexnewbie: no i mean the btrfs-convert tool
Nov 16 00:45:36 .:Sauvin:.	I don't think I'd necessarily trust a power supply to withstand a lightning strike.
Nov 16 00:46:07 .:hexnewbie:.	ayecee: That only works on ext2/3/4 (and, surprisingly, reiserfs)
Nov 16 00:46:17 .:ayecee:.	hexnewbie: manpage says ntfs too
Nov 16 00:46:36 .:ayecee:.	imagine my surprise
Nov 16 00:46:58 .:hexnewbie:.	ayecee: Mine didn't. Opening the web one now, it recommends an external tool
Nov 16 00:47:24 .:ayecee:.	this one says it depends on an external tool, https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-convert.html
Nov 16 00:47:34 .:hexnewbie:.	On Windows, from an Administrator command prompt: ntfs2btrfs.exe D:\
Nov 16 00:48:01 .:Dagmar:.	Oh lightning striking a machine isn't a big problem.  The machine just dies and you know you're 100% done
Nov 16 00:48:01 .:ayecee:.	D:\ looks like a horrified emoticon
Nov 16 00:48:48 .:Dagmar:.	Lighting striking down the block from your house, making everything flicker for a moment before going dark and eerily quiet, _that's_ an actual problem, particularly if your filesystem is being gently slid across the disk
Nov 16 00:49:25 .:Dagmar:.	Then the user has _hope_ and will struggle desperately to recover something useful from the rubble
Nov 16 00:49:27 .:hexnewbie:.	I've never converted a filesystem in-place. The cool kids had tools like this, FAT to Stacker or to DriveSpace, FAT to NTFS, or ext4 to Btrfs. I've just mkfs'd a new disk and copied the data :/
Nov 16 00:49:46 .:Dagmar:.	hexnewbie: Yeah life's too short to risk that crap
Nov 16 00:49:55 .:NyB:.	Dagmar++
Nov 16 00:50:07 .:Sauvin:.	Depends on how you do the move. I've always copied, looked and THEN zapped.
Nov 16 00:50:09 .:hodapp:.	it's easier in DOS because nothing else is there to be touching the filesystem while conversion goes on
Nov 16 00:50:32 »»	rascul touches the filesystem
Nov 16 00:50:48 »»	NyB hears something scream "not there!"
Nov 16 00:50:51 .:Dagmar:.	Unless the in-place FS conversion can be violently interrupted without data loss, it's just not worth the risk
Nov 16 00:50:57 .:hexnewbie:.	hodapp: In-place conversion presumably takes place while unmounted (except fsconvert which requires it to be mounted, I think, so it can use the driver to read data from it, but you can't be touching it while it does)

Nov 16 00:51:56 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: Installation “package”?

Nov 16 00:58:05 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: There are also live images with it, but I don't think one needs anything more than the netinstall: https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/11.5.0-live+nonfree/amd64/iso-hybrid/
Nov 16 00:58:27 .:TurkyLama:.	hrm still need 32 bit :/
Nov 16 00:58:31 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: Then go to the i386 directory instead (and upgrade that system in the meantime)
Nov 16 00:58:39 .:TurkyLama:.	hrm?
Nov 16 00:58:54 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, is your computer 32 bit?
Nov 16 00:59:00 .:TurkyLama:.	I have to install firmware files for the wifi card
Nov 16 00:59:11 .:Dagmar:.	Jesus my wife just asked me if she should open a bin file
Nov 16 00:59:18 .:jim:.	no you don't, there's another way :)
Nov 16 00:59:29 .:Dagmar:.	Some vendor is trying to send her one
Nov 16 00:59:30 .:TurkyLama:.	jim why yes, I have a pile of 32 bitters I am installing linux on
Nov 16 00:59:38 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: The unofficial firmware image has it. No need to add it there. (Regardless of what the state of the inclusion of non-free firmware in the official image is)
Nov 16 01:00:00 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, and you'd like to install debian?
Nov 16 01:00:03 .:Dagmar:.	I am asking her to ask her boss if it's okay if I contact the vendor and how important it is they continue doing business
Nov 16 01:00:08 .:TurkyLama:.	ok so like where do I find the i386 version hexnewbie?
Nov 16 01:00:19 .:TurkyLama:.	why yes jim I would!
Nov 16 01:00:20 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: You go to the i386 directory instead of the amd64 directory
Nov 16 01:00:22 .:jim:.	I'll find the image
Nov 16 01:00:25 .:TurkyLama:.	with support for the wifi card
Nov 16 01:00:29 .:TurkyLama:.	that's the issues
Nov 16 01:00:34 .:TurkyLama:.	oh thanks jim
Nov 16 01:00:41 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: How did you determine I gave you amd64 images?
Nov 16 01:00:54 »»	Dagmar looks at the URL
Nov 16 01:00:58 .:TurkyLama:.	oh it was in the url
Nov 16 01:01:12 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: Yeah, so change it in the URL, and you will be in the i386 images directory
Nov 16 01:01:19 .:Dagmar:.	heh
Nov 16 01:01:25 .:Sauvin:.	I thought 386 got dropped.
Nov 16 01:01:41 .:hexnewbie:.	Sauvin: Not yet, but is why I'm telling TurkyLama it's time to upgrade
Nov 16 01:01:57 .:hexnewbie:.	Things have stopped working with 32 bit systems
Nov 16 01:02:09 .:Dagmar:.	Only mental patients are using 386s anymore
Nov 16 01:02:21 .:Dagmar:.	for everyone else it just means "not a 64-bit CPU"
Nov 16 01:02:22 .:Sauvin:.	I wouldn't word that statement quite so strongly.
Nov 16 01:02:27 »»	mefistofeles is  a mental patient it seems
Nov 16 01:02:49 .:Dagmar:.	mefistofeles: So you're _actually_ using a 386?  SX or DX?
Nov 16 01:03:13 .:TurkyLama:.	not that old Dagmar
Nov 16 01:03:43 .:hexnewbie:.	Why, unless you get yourself a 386, how will you spend the evening (from 6 PM to 4 AM) installing Windows NT 4 on it?
Nov 16 01:03:43 .:TurkyLama:.	I must be a mental patient Dagmar i don't like to toss out useful PCs
Nov 16 01:03:55 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, https://cdimage.debian.org/images/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/11.5.0+nonfree/i386/iso-cd/firmware-11.5.0-i386-netinst.iso
Nov 16 01:03:59 .:Dagmar:.	A _386_
Nov 16 01:04:01 .:TurkyLama:.	sheesh it's not that old!
Nov 16 01:04:11 .:TurkyLama:.	they are like I dunno 12 years old maybe 14
Nov 16 01:04:16 .:Dagmar:.	NOt a pentium, not even a 486, but a _386_
Nov 16 01:04:23 .:Dagmar:.	Oh like hell they are
Nov 16 01:04:36 .:hexnewbie:.	14 year old machines were 64 bit for me
Nov 16 01:04:46 .:hexnewbie:.	My 20 year old laptop was 64 bit
Nov 16 01:04:51 .:Dagmar:.	I think they stopped making them in like 1994 or something
Nov 16 01:04:56 .:hexnewbie:.	I'm not sure how many years I'm off here
Nov 16 01:04:56 .:rascul:.	stack a 386 on top of another one for a coffee table
Nov 16 01:05:00 .:jim:.	Dagmar, yer pickin at him,,, stop dat
Nov 16 01:05:02 .:eirirs:.	I still have a 286 laptop in the basement
Nov 16 01:05:07 .:eirirs:.	from 1986
Nov 16 01:05:15 .:ayecee:.	when's the last time you turned it on though
Nov 16 01:05:16 .:eirirs:.	working
Nov 16 01:05:29 .:hexnewbie:.	eirirs: Turn it off, no need to be wasting power like that
Nov 16 01:05:32 .:eirirs:.	not sure, a few years ago lol, got 2 spare hdds for it, MFM disks
Nov 16 01:05:36 .:Dagmar:.	jim: Just trying to get him to realize he's still mentally conflating 32-bit CPUs and a 386DX-20Mhz
Nov 16 01:05:40 .:eirirs:.	hexnewbie: ha
Nov 16 01:05:53 .:Dagmar:.	They literally didn't go faster than like 40Mhz
Nov 16 01:06:15 .:jim:.	Dagmar, best way: just tell him that
Nov 16 01:06:24 .:jim:.	directly
Nov 16 01:06:40 .:hexnewbie:.	Dagmar: TurkyLama hasn't used the word ‘i386’ in any other context than referring to Debian architecture
Nov 16 01:06:56 .:Dagmar:.	I have done so a couple different ways.  It's possible he doesn't realize the 386 was an actual CPU
Nov 16 01:07:05 .:Dagmar:.	If so, that's not even remotely a big deal
Nov 16 01:07:20 »»	ChanServ sets modes (#linux +o litharge)
Nov 16 01:07:21 »»	litharge sets modes (#linux -bo *!*avalanche@156.17.231.161 litharge)
Nov 16 01:07:30 .:Dagmar:.	I don't think anyone's even compiling binaries that will run on an actual 386 anymore
Nov 16 01:07:43 .:Dagmar:.	So like, if they're using one, it's a museum piece and pretty well-maintained
Nov 16 01:07:53 .:epony:.	hay, 586 is still OK
Nov 16 01:07:54 .:epony:.	:-0
Nov 16 01:08:02 .:TurkyLama:.	I'm not sure what firmware-11.5.0-i386-netinst.iso does
Nov 16 01:08:17 .:Dagmar:.	I think 586 (pentium) is about hte oldest thing one can expect common distributions to work on right now
Nov 16 01:08:18 .:rascul:.	i don't think linux can run on a 386 anymore
Nov 16 01:08:21 .:moha:.	I have installed ovn (open virtual network); and ovn* services ar running; but `ovn-sbctl show` returns notting!
Nov 16 01:08:21 .:epony:.	the i386 is the IA32 arch
Nov 16 01:08:22 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: It's the netinstall image for Debian for x86_32 that contains non-free firmware
Nov 16 01:08:28 .:TurkyLama:.	Dagmar these boxes run linux just fine
Nov 16 01:08:37 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, it's the debian installer for 32-bit
Nov 16 01:08:37 .:Dagmar:.	We just never bothered to change the string we use to indicate 32-bit platforms
Nov 16 01:08:42 .:epony:.	it should mostly work on 486 and 586 CPUs too, other than 386
Nov 16 01:09:12 .:ayecee:.	TurkyLama: you can install debian with it. the image contains device firmware.
Nov 16 01:09:25 .:rascul:.	looks like linux dropped 386 support a decade ago with 3.8
Nov 16 01:09:26 .:TurkyLama:.	ok hexnewbie but I dont want it to install OVER the internet I just want the BMC wifi to work
Nov 16 01:09:31 .:epony:.	there is an 586 forward significant change to 686 which was the P6 micro-arch and later CPUs
Nov 16 01:09:37 .:Dagmar:.	rascul: That's what I thought too
Nov 16 01:09:46 .:TurkyLama:.	no...  debian has i386 support
Nov 16 01:09:50 .:TurkyLama:.	sheesh people! :)
Nov 16 01:10:02 .:rascul:.	debian's 386 is not actually 386
Nov 16 01:10:02 .:ayecee:.	but not 80386 support
Nov 16 01:10:03 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, you would download that image into a file on a disk... then dd the image onto a USB stick... then you boot that
Nov 16 01:10:05 .:Dagmar:.	There was some kerfluffle this year about dropping 486 compatibilty from the kernel if I'm not mistaken
Nov 16 01:10:06 .:epony:.	but modern software done efficiently and in the UNIX principles runs on 586 quite fine
Nov 16 01:10:13 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkyLama: It is a smaller download to use the netinstall image - it only downloads what you select during the install (and even the live image will download security updates over the internet)
Nov 16 01:10:21 .:djph:.	TurkyLama: the "386" processor and "i386 Linux Architecture option" are two completely different things
Nov 16 01:10:23 .:TurkyLama:.	ok Jim
Nov 16 01:10:28 .:TurkyLama:.	that's what I do
Nov 16 01:10:40 .:TurkyLama:.	djph please explain that to Dagmar
Nov 16 01:10:47 .:TurkyLama:.	ok I'll bbl :) thanks
Nov 16 01:10:51 .:epony:.	for example you can fit a recent BSD system like OpenBSD in a 24-32 MB machine but you won
Nov 16 01:10:53 .:ayecee:.	i don't know if that's technically possible.
Nov 16 01:10:56 .:jim:.	TurkyLama, and you'll have debian on that machine :)
Nov 16 01:10:58 .:epony:.	't be able to do much
Nov 16 01:10:59 .:Dagmar:.	TurkyLama: What you're seeing there means x86_32.  It doesn't mean it runs on a 386 or that you are _using_ a 386
Nov 16 01:11:11 .:epony:.	until you add about as much RAM to get to 64 MB
Nov 16 01:11:34 .:epony:.	that works on a P5 machine quite fine
Nov 16 01:11:47 .:rascul:.	i can run i386 stuff
Nov 16 01:11:52 .:ayecee:.	pentium 5 eh
Nov 16 01:11:58 .:epony:.	just the applications which spill CPU cycles will be slow or useless
Nov 16 01:11:58 .:jim:.	oh right, TurkyLama, how much ram does the target machine have?
Nov 16 01:12:03 .:Dagmar:.	Looks like the kernel dropped support for actual 386 CPUs back in 2012

Nov 16 01:38:46 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: you never have to remove the usb installation drive.
Nov 16 01:38:47 .:epony:.	Dagmar, check out the mono noke  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononoke
Nov 16 01:38:53 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: you should not remove the usb installation drive.
Nov 16 01:38:53 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkeyLlama: That's what you did, not what happened
Nov 16 01:38:58 .:TurkeyLlama:.	ayecee AGREED111
Nov 16 01:39:03 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: then why are you doing it
Nov 16 01:39:05 .:Dagmar:.	epony: Probably has something to do with virtually all the instructions taking a known amount of time to execute
Nov 16 01:39:18 .:TurkeyLlama:.	do get the wifi card to install
Nov 16 01:39:27 .:TurkeyLlama:.	there is no other way currently where it will do that
Nov 16 01:39:35 .:epony:.	Dagmar, yes
Nov 16 01:39:41 .:ayecee:.	there is another way, and it is not by removing the current usb.
Nov 16 01:39:44 »»	TurkeyLlama repeats himself over and over
Nov 16 01:39:46 .:epony:.	similar to the in-order execution predictable processing
Nov 16 01:39:55 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: yeah, that's the problem. stop repeating yourself over and over.
Nov 16 01:39:58 .:Dagmar:.	TurkeyLlama: HOw do you know it hasn't done so already?
Nov 16 01:40:01 .:TurkeyLlama:.	correct ayecee and that way is.... ???
Nov 16 01:40:16 .:epony:.	the next state is pre-speculation (non-virtualised) workloads
Nov 16 01:40:23 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: how would i know
Nov 16 01:40:30 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkeyLlama: The wifi just works in the installer (is the way)
Nov 16 01:40:33 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: all i know is the way you're trying over and over again cannot work./.
Nov 16 01:40:40 .:TurkeyLlama:.	I think i will install wifi after I fully install debian
Nov 16 01:40:47 .:epony:.	these bridges exist across the computing ;-) and are more powerful than BIOS addressing / storage limits and such
Nov 16 01:40:53 .:TurkeyLlama:.	and I will repeat mnyself if you stop asking me to
Nov 16 01:40:55 .:Dagmar:.	If you used the non-free image, and *IF* your wifi chipset has any hope of being readily supported, it's not going to make a big deal about it during the install
Nov 16 01:41:02 .:TurkeyLlama:.	it's the same answer over and over again
Nov 16 01:41:20 .:Dagmar:.	You don't have to make any special trip or whatever to install support for a specific device
Nov 16 01:41:24 .:Dagmar:.	That's just not how we roll
Nov 16 01:41:24 .:TurkeyLlama:.	well wifi works once the firmware is installed
Nov 16 01:41:26 .:hexnewbie:.	Yeah, if the wifi is not going to work at all, it won't work even with the firmware image
Nov 16 01:41:40 .:suid_dumpable:.	TurkeyLlama: if you don't need the wifi at installation time, just skip the firmware step and install it later
Nov 16 01:41:49 .:ayecee:.	TurkeyLlama: does wifi work without doing that?
Nov 16 01:41:53 .:TurkeyLlama:.	I can ONLY gt it to install the firmware after removing the installation USB
Nov 16 01:42:08 .:Dagmar:.	Why are you removeing the non-free firmware installer stick?
Nov 16 01:42:17 .:hexnewbie:.	I doubt the sentence “the same thing happens” can apply to the netinstall image and the lxqt live image in any reasonable fashion
Nov 16 01:42:44 .:TurkeyLlama:.	suid_dumpable that is the SMARTEST thing I have heard all day.... of course I said that too.
Nov 16 01:42:44 .:hexnewbie:.	So I fear TurkeyLlama is doing something very wrong here
Nov 16 01:42:50 .:TurkeyLlama:.	okay then problem solved
Nov 16 01:42:52 .:hexnewbie:.	Like, not using the netinstall image at all
Nov 16 01:42:55 .:epony:.	Dagmar, and simpler design, patents expiration, linear scaling of performance and timing (at design stage) with frequency increase and simple and highly reliable (including implementation defects elimination) platforms
Nov 16 01:42:59 .:TurkeyLlama:.	hexnewbie not me!
Nov 16 01:43:10 .:TurkeyLlama:.	I am doing something very right
Nov 16 01:43:17 .:Dagmar:.	hexnewbie: Which is impressive considering how many times and how many different ways we have said to use the non-free installer
Nov 16 01:43:28 .:TurkeyLlama:.	thanks suid_dumpable that is what I suggested and that is what I am going to do :)
Nov 16 01:43:38 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkeyLlama: When you are starting the installer, do you start the installer that *jim gave you*, or the one you had previously?
Nov 16 01:43:52 .:TurkeyLlama:.	both hexnewbie both
Nov 16 01:43:53 .:ayecee:.	hexnewbie: let's not keep peeling the same onion here.
Nov 16 01:43:59 .:TurkeyLlama:.	same things happen each time
Nov 16 01:44:01 .:TurkeyLlama:.	no change
Nov 16 01:44:01 .:NyB:.	TurkeyLlama: ...if you can install without the WiFi, then why have we been having this discussion?
Nov 16 01:44:02 .:Dagmar:.	No, that's literally not how that works
Nov 16 01:44:02 .:hexnewbie:.	TurkeyLlama: How do you start two installers at the same time
Nov 16 01:44:03 .:ayecee:.	let the turkey finish the install.
Nov 16 01:44:18 .:epony:.	or the install will finish the leftover turkey ;-)
Nov 16 01:44:20 .:TurkeyLlama:.	myb we're not... bye for now thanks guys :)
Nov 16 01:44:32 »»	NyB is confused, but OK...
Nov 16 01:44:42 .:jim:.	TurkeyLlama, did it boot?
Nov 16 01:44:52 .:ayecee:.	jim: gonna have to be more specific
Nov 16 01:44:53 .:TurkeyLlama:.	yeah a lot of that going around NyB
Nov 16 01:44:55 .:Dagmar:.	NyB: but not confused enough to remove the USB stick in the middle of the installation process
Nov 16 01:45:00 .:Sauvin:.	Oh, yeah, that's right, Turkey Day is coming up pretty soon, isn't it?
Nov 16 01:45:06 .:suid_dumpable:.	there was just the impression TurkeyLlama needed wifi at installation time...
Nov 16 01:45:14 .:ayecee:.	nah, turkey day was a month ago!
Nov 16 01:45:32 .:TurkeyLlama:.	no suid_dumpable I knew I coud install without wifi I just didn' want to
Nov 16 01:45:36 .:TurkeyLlama:.	ok bye for now thanks again
Nov 16 01:45:38 .:Khaytsus:.	Plenty of turkeys in here daily
Nov 16 01:45:46 .:Dagmar:.	suid_dumpable: I was under the impression they didn't have any other way to get the wifi driver into the thing _after_ installation because they didn't have a clue how to do so

Nov 16 12:14:40 .:mrig:.	oh cool, just trying a new distribution, its been quite refreshing as it gives a clearer notion as to what is distribution set so which are linux's configurable properties.
Nov 16 12:15:46 .:mrig:.	reading about mounting, I'd not realised how fundamental a thing it is, but of course, everything is a file so it ought to have been obvious :D

Nov 16 12:12:19 .:woland:.	mrig: what distro are you trying?
Nov 16 12:18:08 .:mrig:.	I'm trying fedora, have until now used only debian and ubunut.
Nov 16 12:18:19 .:mrig:.	ubuntu rather.
Nov 16 12:13:35 .:woland:.	most distros use udiskie to automate mounting and stuff 
Nov 16 12:13:45 .:woland:.	its a front to udisks2 
Nov 16 12:14:22 .:woland:.	never used ubuntu in my life tho, debian was my first 
Nov 16 12:19:47 .:mrig:.	all the different ways of mounting makes it pretty confusing at first, but am getting the hang of it I think.
Nov 16 12:20:28 .:Jong:.	thanks   hello-operator:
Nov 16 12:16:20 .:woland:.	mrig:  you can always use udisks2 with udisksctl
Nov 16 12:16:37 .:woland:.	udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdc1
Nov 16 12:22:25 .:mrig:.	yes that's what I currently use when in i3
Nov 16 12:17:37 .:woland:.	Im also in i3, I autostart udiskie with i3 and it does it on its own
Nov 16 12:23:07 .:mrig:.	took me a while to figure out that it is the distribution set up that does the auto mount when you plug usb devices in.
Nov 16 12:18:19 .:woland:.	yea so much we take for granted 
Nov 16 12:23:40 .:mrig:.	oh right, that's the code that gnome or what ever is using.
Nov 16 12:18:37 .:woland:.	until we switch to a WM and become adults lol
Nov 16 12:24:06 .:mrig:.	Gets so that you cant see the forest for the trees though.
Nov 16 12:24:19 .:mrig:.	when using the GUI
Nov 16 12:24:56 .:mrig:.	would love to mod GNOME though, so that it was half way between its current way and i3.
Nov 16 12:20:33 .:woland:.	I could never stand gnome, too mac-like, kde was the only DE I used before switching to dwm and then to i3 where I will live forever 
Nov 16 12:27:04 .:mrig:.	Shame though, I'm not going anywhere near JS at the moment.
Nov 16 12:27:36 .:mrig:.	I like GNOME, because as it is more like vim. Not fond of kde as it is too much like windows.
Nov 16 12:27:54 .:mrig:.	but GNOME is not enough like vim is my gripe with it :D
Nov 16 12:28:47 .:mrig:.	i3 is super, but not as nice to to look at if you do have the resources to support the gizmos and gadgets.
Nov 16 12:29:12 .:mrig:.	can imagine far better though, a better terminal is my pipe dream.
Nov 16 12:29:32 .:mrig:.	more useful gizmos and gadgets :D
Nov 16 12:33:26 .:mrig:.	love being able to get rid of all the excess window paraphernalia in i3 though, I use a 12" screen so it really makes a difference to me. Having two windows open side by side and no borders of headers great, makes the screen size very usable.
Nov 16 12:31:55 .:woland:.	you can set the font to 0 and get rid of the title bars
Nov 16 12:37:30 .:scatterp:.	hi I want to run a nameserver on a machine (we can call it hub) connected to a private network such that if i request from "my-address" domain machine1.example.com (this request is logged specifically requesting ip) then the hub ip is returned but connections to the hub from my-address are forwarded to machine1 is there any kind of linux package
Nov 16 12:37:31 .:scatterp:.	for this ?
Nov 16 12:32:18 .:woland:.	make sure to specify a different font size for your bar tho
Nov 16 12:37:56 <mrig>	woland: oh! That sounds like a cool pointer!
Nov 16 12:38:53 .:mrig:.	where is the bar font size set? Do you mean in i3?
Nov 16 12:34:09 .:woland:.	yea in i3 you got a line that says "font xft:Mononoki 0"
Nov 16 12:34:34 .:woland:.	and just add the same line between the bar {} function but with a size of 10 or sth 
Nov 16 12:34:46 .:woland:.	otherwise your bar will be unreadable 
Nov 16 12:40:38 .:mrig:.	Thanks! I'll try that, I think my bar is set to another size, not sure where from memory, will take a look.
Nov 16 12:42:39 .:scatterp:.	reposting (i think it didnt send as i was not signed in) Hi I want to run a nameserver on a machine (we can call it hub) connected to a private network such that if i request from "my-address" domain machine1.example.com (this request is logged specifically requesting ip) then the hub ip is returned but connections to the hub from my-address are
Nov 16 12:42:39 .:scatterp:.	forwarded to machine1 is there any kind of linux package for this ?
Nov 16 12:43:45 .:mlu:.	scatterp: sure, bind or named
Nov 16 12:44:05 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you're just running an internal DNS -- just need to make sure that your internal machines are only using that DNS server and not something else
Nov 16 12:38:51 .:woland:.	mrig: http://ix.io/4g0V something like this
Nov 16 12:44:52 .:scatterp:.	mlu i mean my request is external to that network over the internet
Nov 16 12:46:19 .:scatterp:.	so i am coming in from wan side..
Nov 16 12:50:17 <mrig>	woland: Oh I think I already have them turned off with 'new_window none'
Nov 16 12:50:35 .:mlu:.	scatterp: oh, that's impossible to do :)
Nov 16 12:50:51 .:mrig:.	I'd love to be able to do this in GNOME too, and hide and reveal the status bar.
Nov 16 12:51:27 .:mrig:.	admittedly a specific use case, not many use only one 12" screen :D
Nov 16 12:51:27 .:Norkle:.	WHEN THE RAINBOW IS SHINING ON YOU ALL YOUR DREAMS WITH SHINE OVER YOU!
Nov 16 12:51:33 .:scatterp:.	mlu thats what i keep hearing but i dont get why.. which part exactly is impossible? log the ip... forward traffic from the ip ?
Nov 16 12:54:49 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you cannot just override DNS for someone else
Nov 16 12:55:00 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you can only ocnfigure your machines to talk to a namserver, which can give certain results
Nov 16 12:55:17 .:mlu:.	scatterp: i.e. it's impossible because you don't control it
Nov 16 12:55:35 .:scatterp:.	mlu so i cant get the requesting ip you mean ?
Nov 16 12:56:10 .:mlu:.	scatterp: correct
Nov 16 12:56:36 .:mlu:.	scatterp: unless a machine is talking to your DNS server, it will just resolve using the nameservers configured for that domain
Nov 16 12:57:27 .:scatterp:.	mlu yeah so if i am running the dns/ns i can log the ip no ?
Nov 16 12:57:38 .:mlu:.	scatterp: still a no -- because of how DNS works
Nov 16 12:57:58 .:mlu:.	scatterp: it's heavily cached and distributed -- so not everyone connects to your nameserver
Nov 16 12:58:09 .:scatterp:.	oh i mean ttl 0
Nov 16 12:58:15 .:mlu:.	the client would connect to a recursive naemserver, which will resolve the records themselves and cache the results
Nov 16 12:58:39 .:mlu:.	scatterp: even in that case, it's still a no because it's the rdns resolving, not the clients itself
Nov 16 12:58:57 .:mlu:.	i.e. if the user uses 8.8.8.8, for example, it's Google that resolves the name, not the client
Nov 16 12:59:08 .:mlu:.	you will see Google make a request to your nameserver and that would be it
Nov 16 12:59:17 .:scatterp:.	mlu drat :(
Nov 16 12:59:31 .:scatterp:.	mlu then how does dns tunneling work ?
Nov 16 12:59:33 .:mlu:.	yeah, if you're thinking about tracking someone this way -- it won't work
Nov 16 12:59:46 .:mlu:.	scatterp: different concept

Nov 16 12:59:56 .:scatterp:.	mlu no i just have a bunch of machines with no public ips
Nov 16 13:00:02 .:mlu:.	scatterp: with DNS tunneling, you don't need to track the client's IP
Nov 16 13:00:19 .:mlu:.	it's very slow, but you can encode the requests in TXT record requests and eventaully get thru

Nov 16 13:01:23 .:scatterp:.	i have already setup a vpn on them all
Nov 16 13:01:27 .:mlu:.	scatterp: in that case, look at OpenVPN
Nov 16 13:01:51 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you're running the VPN endpiont, right?
Nov 16 13:02:10 .:mlu:.	it needs to be one you control and actually located inside your network for this to work
Nov 16 13:02:20 .:mlu:.	ie. you can't just NordVPN/ExpressVPN all of them
Nov 16 13:02:59 .:mlu:.	because even though those are VPNs, it's not inside your network hence useless for remote access
Nov 16 13:03:27 .:scatterp:.	yes i have tailscale network inside
Nov 16 13:04:23 .:mlu:.	scatterp: in this case, you will need to connect to your VPN, and then you can get access to the inside
Nov 16 13:04:32 .:scatterp:.	but the issue now is i dont want it to be private.. i want to host services like onworks.net and those services in terms of ports are not really defined yet so i wanted to have like a way to get free public ip basically
Nov 16 13:04:37 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you'll want your VPN software to configure an internal DNS server for when you are connected
Nov 16 13:04:47 .:mlu:.	scatterp: oh, that's impossible :)
Nov 16 13:05:08 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you need a public IP to do it publicly -- a VPN won't get your around that
Nov 16 13:05:20 .:mlu:.	scatterp: the best you can do is have an endpoint with a public IP that tunnels to your private network
Nov 16 13:05:22 .:scatterp:.	yeah i think what i need to do is grab the user ip from a front end when they want to start a system and forward it that way
Nov 16 13:05:35 .:mlu:.	scatterp: but at that point, you might as well just host them on the cloud anyways
Nov 16 13:05:53 .:scatterp:.	like i want to boot a ubuntu instance.. so then grab that users ip and forward it to that instance
Nov 16 13:05:54 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you can't do that because you don't control their system
Nov 16 13:06:18 .:scatterp:.	but there launching it from my site like onworks.net
Nov 16 13:07:11 .:mlu:.	if you want it to work, you will either need a gateway that reverse proxies from the public internet, or you will need to configure the connecting users on to your VPN (a non-trivial task)
Nov 16 13:07:15 .:scatterp:.	still its not full ip because ports cant be shared ok whole concept sucks need to rethink it
Nov 16 13:07:56 .:scatterp:.	mlu actually tailscale is pretty awesome its free.. and one liners for linux win installer etc android but i wanted to avoid that
Nov 16 13:08:17 .:mlu:.	hehe, I use wireguard directly :)
Nov 16 13:08:37 .:mlu:.	very useful for office-to-office intranets
Nov 16 13:08:52 .:mlu:.	nothing quite like being able to print to the office printer when working from home
Nov 16 13:08:55 .:scatterp:.	wonder about dnssec maybe that could leak the ip
Nov 16 13:09:15 .:scatterp:.	i keep meaning to config google printing
Nov 16 13:10:36 .:mlu:.	scatterp: nope
Nov 16 13:11:09 .:mlu:.	scatterp: dnssec just makes sure you can't return false DNS results -- actually makes it so that when you do use a custom DNS server, things break
Nov 16 13:11:19 .:mlu:.	i.e. it actually makes what you want to do even more impossible
Nov 16 13:11:42 .:mlu:.	the short versino is that if you want to provide a public service, you need a publicly accessible endpoint
Nov 16 13:11:52 .:scatterp:.	so the failure point is dns with the plan interesting i was dreaming of using hns and having I.P
Nov 16 13:11:58 .:mlu:.	being able to do that is costly, and IPv4 addresses are in short supply (so also costly)
Nov 16 13:12:25 .:scatterp:.	yeah maybe i can direct route a ipv6 stack some how
Nov 16 13:12:46 .:mlu:.	it depends on your ISP -- the good news with IPv6 is that it's generally been desinged to avoid NAT, etc.
Nov 16 13:13:12 .:mlu:.	so all you need to do is setup some dynamic DNS (see DynDNS or NoIP) and update that with a client
Nov 16 13:13:34 .:mlu:.	check your ISP's terms of service before doing so -- most of them explicitly prohibit doing stuff like that
Nov 16 13:13:48 .:scatterp:.	well upstream from my server theres no ipv6 but i am wondering if i can get like some from somewhere and then route it
Nov 16 13:14:16 .:mlu:.	scatterp: sure -- Hurricane Electric provides a nice IPv6 tunneling service
Nov 16 13:15:04 .:mlu:.	scatterp: https://www.tunnelbroker.net/
Nov 16 13:15:28 .:scatterp:.	yeah looks like i have ipv6 private addresses via tailscale right now
Nov 16 13:16:15 .:mlu:.	that tunnelbroker service will make it so that you have blocks of public IPv6 addresses
Nov 16 13:16:28 .:mlu:.	it's just that it routes through one of their endpoints
Nov 16 13:17:02 .:mlu:.	if your ISP is cool, though, they might offer you some natively usable IPv6 blocks -- unlike with IPv4, those are actually cheap and plenty available
Nov 16 13:18:46 .:scatterp:.	i doubt ill get more from the upstream they dont even provide ipv4
Nov 16 13:18:58 .:scatterp:.	but seems like this can work
Nov 16 13:20:17 .:mlu:.	scatterp: if your upsteram doesn't give you an ipv4, you can't use that :(
Nov 16 13:21:38 .:scatterp:.	yeah need to think some more
Nov 16 13:27:47 .:scatterp:.	mlu anyway thanks for the help got to go to a zoom
Nov 16 13:28:05 .:mlu:.	get a better upstream

Nov 16 13:29:07 .:eshmaki:.	Oops
Nov 16 13:39:40 .:joto:.	hello, I have got this unit line defined: After=mnt-storage.mount --> I can find a reference in /etc/fstab but shouldn't there be a dedicated file called 'mnt-storage.mount' somewhere too?
Nov 16 13:46:09 .:djph:.	joto: I don't think so, no
Nov 16 13:46:16 .:joto:.	okay thanks for confirming :-)
Nov 16 13:46:47 .:djph:.	joto: as I (poorly) recall, that's just "a step" in the systemd init process, and not necessarily a separate unit
Nov 16 13:47:14 .:djph:.	e.g. the unit file for "mount" may simply provide the step named "mnt-storage.mount"
Nov 16 13:47:48 .:joto:.	alrighty. I can see via df -h that /mnt/storage exists. So I guess the system automatically maps the naming to "mnt-storage.mount" that way.
Nov 16 13:48:15 .:joto:.	I should read up on the naming conventions to be absolutly sure but I think this is the correct patern.
Nov 16 14:10:08 .:Czernobog:.	Hello how do I stop the grub menu from displaying when I boot? I changed the GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 in /etc/default/grub but nothing happened
Nov 16 14:10:30 .:X7:.	Czernobog Did you reurn the grub-config command?
Nov 16 14:10:42 .:Czernobog:.	^I updated grub with `sudo update-grub` after changing that file
Nov 16 14:10:42 .:djph:.	Czernobog: did you then run update-grub?
Nov 16 14:10:47 .:X7:.	*update-grub
Nov 16 14:10:58 .:X7:.	Yeah, I got it right the first time.
Nov 16 14:11:06 .:Czernobog:.	yes, I did
Nov 16 14:11:12 .:thyri:.	Howdy - I have found this explanation of setting the uefi boot splash to the correct resolution to avoid flickers during boot even with a dedicated graphics card https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/miuloo/can_i_change_the_bios_uefi_boot_resolution/ - what is the equivalent way to do this on Linux ?
Nov 16 14:11:33 .:mlu:.	thyri: nomodeset in the command line
Nov 16 14:11:35 .:hexnewbie:.	Timeout of 0 sounds risky
Nov 16 14:11:51 .:hexnewbie:.	It may even be deliberately preventing you from using 0 (or interpreting 0 as infinite)
Nov 16 14:12:02 .:X7:.	Try GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden as well Czernobog.
Nov 16 14:12:21 .:Czernobog:.	and idk I just don't want to press the "enter" or wait for 30 seconds more before it boots the OS
Nov 16 14:12:42 .:X7:.	It's common for some distros if no other OS is found to just skip the grub prompt.
Nov 16 14:12:43 .:Czernobog:.	GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden is already there
Nov 16 14:12:50 .:thyri:.	Mlu thank you
Nov 16 14:13:07 .:djph:.	Czernobog: sounds like you're talking to the wrong grub then
Nov 16 14:13:29 .:Czernobog:.	how many grub are there supposed to be?
Nov 16 14:13:30 .:hexnewbie:.	Czernobog: Wait 5 seconds instead, then? Mine is at GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 (as is I suspect the default on my distro)
Nov 16 14:13:35 .:X7:.	What distro are you on anyways Czernobog?
Nov 16 14:13:43 .:Czernobog:.	Ubuntu 20.04
Nov 16 14:14:31 .:Czernobog:.	I have installed it manually by setting the efi partition to ext4 and root partition to btrfs
Nov 16 14:14:43 .:Czernobog:.	i used ext4 on purpose
Nov 16 14:15:04 .:Czernobog:.	for efi partition
Nov 16 14:15:10 .:djph:.	uh, as I understand things, the EFI partition has to be FAT
Nov 16 14:15:18 .:thyri:.	Czernobog I have the same issue - I think there is some way grub detects it hasn't been shut down correctly and then shows the grub anyways - I don't know how ( maybe it is an uptime counter and when it is too low it shows grub on next boot ) -- there is a grub option you can set to something like 5 where grub needs 5 fails before it shows
Nov 16 14:15:26 .:mlu:.	Czernobog: uh, that won't work
Nov 16 14:15:38 .:mlu:.	EFI partition must be a filesystem that the UEFI firmware supports
Nov 16 14:15:53 .:mlu:.	only FAT support is specified as required in the spec
Nov 16 14:15:57 .:Czernobog:.	usually efi is ext4 on rhel and root is xfs so I wanted try that but with btrfs
Nov 16 14:16:11 .:Czernobog:.	okay I see
Nov 16 14:16:18 .:mlu:.	tehy can implement other filesystems if they want to, but it's not guaranteed (i.e. most x86 mobos support booting from NTFS also)
Nov 16 14:16:35 .:mlu:.	it really dependso n your motherboadr though
Nov 16 14:16:54 .:hexnewbie:.	There is no way this is true: “usually efi is ext4 on rhel”
Nov 16 14:17:02 .:mlu:.	you sure it's not just /boot?
Nov 16 14:17:26 .:Czernobog:.	oh yeah omg it's the /boot
Nov 16 14:17:29 .:Czernobog:.	oops
Nov 16 14:18:04 .:mlu:.	in most systems I've seen, the EFI system partition is mounted as /boot/efi when needed
Nov 16 14:18:36 .:Czernobog:.	yep
Nov 16 14:21:47 .:Czernobog:.	can someone explain why it says as ESP filesystem
Nov 16 14:21:52 .:Czernobog:.	what is ESP
Nov 16 14:22:17 .:X7:.	I think ubuntu systems use ESP over swap. Linux Mint does that too.
Nov 16 14:22:51 .:p0g0:.	EFI System Partition
Nov 16 14:23:42 .:Anone:.	hello guys, somebody can help me about manjaro problems ?
Nov 16 14:23:43 .:Czernobog:.	wait what's the difference between efi and boot partition
Nov 16 14:24:08 .:p0g0:.	It's where the UEFI looks for OS and utility files.
Nov 16 14:25:14 .:Czernobog:.	p0g0 I kind of know that but why can't efi be ext4 but boot can
Nov 16 14:25:38 .:Anone:.	i try to using tools like make node and more ...
Nov 16 14:25:48 .:hexnewbie:.	Czernobog: The EFI system partition is accessed by the firmware (to read grub from), the /boot partition is accessed by Grub
Nov 16 14:26:01 .:Anone:.	but manjaro have problem with share libraries
Nov 16 14:26:39 .:hexnewbie:.	Czernobog: (U)EFI firmware being the successor to what used to be known as BIOS, so you can mentally replace the word ‘firmware’ with ‘BIOS’
Nov 16 14:26:58 .:scatterp:.	mlu still around i think i have a solution?
Nov 16 14:27:11 .:mlu:.	scatterp: no, I'm gone for the night :P
Nov 16 14:27:17 .:Anone:.	uninstall manjaro ?
Nov 16 14:27:41 .:Czernobog:.	so the firmware looks for grub in efi and and grub looks for OS in boot?
Nov 16 14:27:46 .:scatterp:.	mlu was thinking x.x.x.x.is.my.ip.destination.server.com now the ns has the ip
Nov 16 14:28:39 .:djph:.	Czernobog: more or less
Nov 16 14:28:51 .:mlu:.	scatterp: hmm, looks liek you just needed some dynamic DNS?
Nov 16 14:29:06 .:Anone:.	some guys want to be a bullshit, they should install windows
Nov 16 14:29:13 .:scatterp:.	mlu but now the original plan works because i know requester ip right ?
Nov 16 14:29:32 .:mlu:.	only when they actually connect to your server
Nov 16 14:29:40 .:scatterp:.	right
Nov 16 14:29:48 .:scatterp:.	which is the dns response
Nov 16 14:30:00 .:scatterp:.	*.server responds with the server ip
Nov 16 14:30:16 .:Czernobog:.	alright, thanks
Nov 16 14:31:21 .:scatterp:.	and so i guess now it "works" theres no such package already to do it ?
Nov 16 14:32:55 .:vlt:.	Hello. What tool can I use to *check* if I can connect to a wireless network and get an IP address via DHCP without actually changing any of my network configuration like (default) routes or resolv.conf?
Nov 16 14:33:25 .:scatterp:.	vit a phone ?
Nov 16 14:33:37 .:mlu:.	scatterp: you'll need a service, not just a package
Nov 16 14:34:07 .:scatterp:.	mlu so i got to basically create it from scratch
Nov 16 14:34:29 .:p0g0:.	vlt a station would  need to associate, usthenticate, then ask for a DHCP result.
Nov 16 14:34:41 .:p0g0:.	*authenticate
Nov 16 14:34:50 .:vlt:.	scatterp: Yes, could run on a phone if that helps.
Nov 16 14:34:57 .:mlu:.	scatterp: NoIP and DynDNS, also Namecheap and Afraid.net
Nov 16 14:35:25 .:vlt:.	p0g0: Yes, it should do all that.
Nov 16 14:35:40 .:vlt:.	p0g0: Do you know of any tool that does that?
Nov 16 14:35:55 .:scatterp:.	mlu yeah im thinking afraid.net and custom name server to log results parse those for 4 bytes for ip and 1 byte for destination and add the rule with ipset
Nov 16 14:36:18 .:p0g0:.	vlt any wifi client, so your wireless router, cell phone, or wifi enabled laptop, etc.
Nov 16 14:36:22 .:Czernobog:.	i would like to know this as well. My raspberryPi keeps losing connectivity and it does not connect back at all. Really hate it
Nov 16 14:36:51 .:ne2k:.	scatterp I missed the start, what are you trying to achieve?
Nov 16 14:37:43 .:vlt:.	p0g0: Ok, let's say I have a laptop. What tool will connect to the wifi, authenticate and then ask for an IP address (without assigning it to the wlan0 device then)?
Nov 16 14:38:48 .:ne2k:.	vit: why not just do it the normal way and then undo it? you /could/ get a dhcp client to request an address and not assign it, but it seems a bit daft unless you have a very special requirement
Nov 16 14:39:04 .:p0g0:.	vlt, well, either a VM, a second wifi interface, or such, or just use the one you have, make the new connection, get the info you want, then reconnect to your original AP
Nov 16 14:39:22 .:scatterp:.	ne2k so i have a bunch of qemus on a tailscaled network and the current idea is to have a domain like x.x.x.x.is.my.ip.landest.mything.afraid.org where *mything.afraid.org returns a single ip and the query is logged my internet ip is then routed to the landest and i was looking for a do it for me package
Nov 16 14:39:40 .:B-|:.	how possible is compiling a commin distro with tcc
Nov 16 14:39:47 .:B-|:.	common
Nov 16 14:39:52 .:Czernobog:.	what's tcc
Nov 16 14:39:58 .:X7:.	It's a very tiny C compiler.
Nov 16 14:40:13 .:X7:.	None of the optimizations gcc or clang provides. But it compiles VERY fast.
Nov 16 14:40:16 .:ne2k:.	scatterp not familiar with tailscale, it seems to be some sort of VPN service?
Nov 16 14:40:30 .:scatterp:.	free vpn service quite nice opensource plug and play
Nov 16 14:40:38 .:ne2k:.	also I have no idea what a landest is
Nov 16 14:40:52 .:Czernobog:.	tailscale is nice I prefer zerotier but recently zt is having major issues
Nov 16 14:40:52 .:scatterp:.	lan-destination a vpn client with a private ip address
Nov 16 14:41:02 .:vlt:.	p0g0: Sounds good. My wifi interface is not in use. I'm afraid I fail to phrase my question properly. The "get the info you want" part, what do I use for that?
Nov 16 14:41:03 .:X7:.	B-|. Why are you using tcc anyways? If you want to compile the kernel, you HAVE to use gcc. I don't know if the clang patches were added yet or not.
Nov 16 14:41:41 .:ne2k:.	scatterp I think a more thorough example might be helpful. your description seems a bit abbreviated
Nov 16 14:41:51 .:scatterp:.	yes sorry let me try again
Nov 16 14:42:06 .:Czernobog:.	what about musl?
Nov 16 14:44:08 .:p0g0:.	vlt, netmanager, connman, or such (or you can do it by hand using the network settings).  You'd just tell NM/connman to attach to the wireless interface, than look at the /etc/resolv.conf & assigned IP returned from the dhcp call, then rerun NM/connman to restore your original (wired?) connection.
Nov 16 14:44:31 .:scatterp:.	so i have a bunch of qemus on a tailscaled network where each qemu has a local private ip address and the current idea is to have a domain like x.x.x.x.is.my.ip.landest.mything.afraid.org (x.x.x.x is my public ip) where *mything.afraid.org returns a single ipv4 address (running the nameserver and routing)  and the query is logged my public
Nov 16 14:44:31 .:scatterp:.	internet ip (from) is then routed (to) the local private ip of a qemu instance ...  and i was looking for a do it for me package
Nov 16 14:45:25 .:vlt:.	p0g0: Hmm, that's the problem. I want to run all this *without* changing routes or resolv.conf. I'm sorry if I couldn't make that clear earlier.
Nov 16 14:45:46 .:p0g0:.	vlt, run a VM then.
Nov 16 14:46:25 .:p0g0:.	vlt, someone else might know a better way.
Nov 16 14:46:27 »»	vlt is sure there must be an easier way
Nov 16 14:47:56 .:vlt:.	I had hoped for an nmap thing or something like that that will perform a DHCP request and release cycle without assigning anything to the current system.
Nov 16 14:49:01 .:djph:.	vlt: nope, not gonna really find anything like that
Nov 16 14:50:52 .:vlt:.	Maybe https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html is something to work with.
Nov 16 14:51:40 .:Czernobog:.	clear
Nov 16 14:51:45 .:Czernobog:.	clear
Nov 16 14:51:50 .:Czernobog:.	oops
Nov 16 14:52:28 .:vlt:.	Or I'll have to look at how nagios/Icinga do it.
Nov 16 14:58:04 .:chiselfuse:.	do you think linux/unix is going to die any time soon?
Nov 16 14:58:38 .:live1:.	hehehe
Nov 16 14:58:45 .:live1:.	who/what will kill it?
Nov 16 14:59:12 .:cartdrige:.	it won't, but BSD might ressussitate one day though.
Nov 16 14:59:35 .:cartdrige:.	Like the Christ in his days :P
Nov 16 14:59:39 .:live1:.	we've got an OS that came out of a (Bell) LAB... most advanced piece of technology _right now_.
Nov 16 14:59:43 .:chiselfuse:.	well BSD is unixish enough to me so it means that no
Nov 16 14:59:55 .:live1:.	even if that happens, it's still GPL
Nov 16 14:59:55 .:X7:.	Too much has been invested into linux to die anytime soon.
Nov 16 15:00:04 .:oerheks:.	trolls never die, like linux
Nov 16 15:00:23 .:Czernobog:.	live1: what is this os called
Nov 16 15:00:28 .:silv3r_m00n:.	hi there, i have windows + ubuntu installed on my acer swift 3 laptop and both booting with uefi ... when i turn on my laptop i see the GRUB2 boot menu, isnt there supposed to be some kind of UEFI boot menu for selecting the os to boot ?
Nov 16 15:00:35 .:live1:.	hehe Czernobog
Nov 16 15:00:41 .:X7:.	Have you guys tried TempleOS?
Nov 16 15:01:14 .:Czernobog:.	silv3r_m00n Never dual booted so idk sorry
Nov 16 15:01:18 .:chiselfuse:.	X7: please leave religion out of the discussion sir
Nov 16 15:01:19 .:X7:.	silv3r_m00n. GRUB2 overwrites the windows boot loader that you may  be used to seeing.
Nov 16 15:01:32 .:jim:.	X7, no, have you?
Nov 16 15:01:35 .:chiselfuse:.	well what about ReactOS, is that going anywhere?
Nov 16 15:01:45 .:live1:.	silv3r_m00n: no, not really. GRUB2 is the default thing. what do you mean by UEFI boot menu? you mean something lower, like a BIOS/UEFI boot menu? Definetely no. GRUB2 is expected and the default thing, it's the bootloader.
Nov 16 15:01:57 .:vlt:.	silv3r_m00n: That depends on Acer's choice of setup.
Nov 16 15:02:05 .:X7:.	chiselfuse. Not really. If you want to help ReactOS, start funding wine.
Nov 16 15:02:06 .:Czernobog:.	reactOS sounds like a java script based OS. Everything java lol
Nov 16 15:02:09 .:live1:.	silv3r_m00n: describe more what are you expecting when meaning 'UEFI boot menu'.
Nov 16 15:02:18 .:hexnewbie:.	silv3r_m00n: Those are not in conflict. You see GRUB 2 boot menu by default (it ought to have Windows entry if os-prober worked), and additionally there should be an UEFI boot menu entry (if you invoke it)
Nov 16 15:02:48 .:silv3r_m00n:.	live1: i mean UEFI is supposed to be advanced, should it should have somekind of boot menu with all OS entries and letting the user the select. the GRUB2 is certainly more prevalent'
Nov 16 15:03:00 .:jim:.	well java is different from javascript
Nov 16 15:03:11 .:silv3r_m00n:.	hexnewbie: let me check the UEFI settings again
Nov 16 15:03:33 .:Czernobog:.	I just had this talk
Nov 16 15:03:36 .:silv3r_m00n:.	basically if i am seeing GRUB2 boot menu doesnt that mean that UEFI already initiated Ubuntu boot ?
Nov 16 15:03:53 .:X7:.	There is no "ubntu boot" just grub.
Nov 16 15:03:53 .:Czernobog:.	uefi searchs for grub and grub searches for OS.
Nov 16 15:04:38 .:silv3r_m00n:.	Czernobog: i think grub sits parallel to windows inside EFI system partition
Nov 16 15:04:40 .:live1:.	silv3r_m00n: No. GRUB2 is the bootloader which will have _all_ OS (bootable) entries. UEFI is lower level - it's like BIOS. GRUB is one abstraction level upwards, a bootloader. UEFI would be the motherboard initialization system/hardware control and such.
Nov 16 15:04:45 .:silv3r_m00n:.	so ideally UEFI could trigger windows as well
Nov 16 15:05:16 .:live1:.	GRUB2 could be used with Windows only, and is not tied to any OS (be it Ubuntu, or other)
Nov 16 15:05:24 .:X7:.	Unless you're on slackware, that uses LILO/ELILO by default.
Nov 16 15:05:34 .:Czernobog:.	uefi is a firmware which is installed on your computer's motherboard. It does the POST test and searches for grub which in turn searches for the OS
Nov 16 15:06:01 .:live1:.	If you are seeing 'Windows' entry and 'Ubuntu' one, and both work, that's it. Lots of folks dual booting have the same setup, and that setup that you are mentioning (GRUB2 bootloader) is the default.
Nov 16 15:06:40 .:silv3r_m00n:.	wait let me check
Nov 16 15:06:53 .:live1:.	If you wish to seek UEFI boot like menu, go enter your system BIOS (UEFI) and see the options/boot menu entries t here.
Nov 16 15:07:54 .:live1:.	So, to answer your question. No. There shouldn't be an UEFI boot menu, as GRUB2 is the default "boot menu". UEFI is a lower apstraction, a motherboard firmware.
Nov 16 15:08:00 .:thyriaen:.	i would like to startup with kernel parameter nomodeset enabled, because it removes flickering during boot. However when i then login into my xserver i seems amdgpu doesn't get loaded - how can i do that ?
Nov 16 15:10:45 .:silv3r_m00n:.	live1: i just checked UEFI settings > Boot (pressing F2) at machine start... and there is a boot order setting which has 1. ubuntu 2. windows. if i move windows up, laptop boots straight into Windows 10. if i move ubuntu up, the laptop shows GRUB2 allowing selection of ubuntu or windows
Nov 16 15:11:17 .:oerheks:.	os prober is disabled, so there is no windows in grub menu
Nov 16 15:11:24 .:silv3r_m00n:.	this means that GRUB and Windows Loader are sitting side by side, just that GRUB lets access to windows, while windows does not let access to ubuntu
Nov 16 15:11:37 .:oerheks:.	enable osprober again, it is disabled due to security concerns
Nov 16 15:13:17 .:live1:.	Hmm, what do you mean by 'side to side'? Windows has it's own default boot program, tied to the OS. Just as Linux does, but not tied. What is the expected/desired result silv3r_m00n?
Nov 16 15:17:17 .:live1:.	windows has 'bootmgr' if im not mistaken, and it's tied to the windows OS. tied as in baked in, can't modify/change it. GRUB loads that thing.
Nov 16 15:20:35 .:silv3r_m00n:.	live1: correct
Nov 16 15:21:12 .:NorrinRadd:.	sysRPL wow
Nov 16 15:21:23 .:NorrinRadd:.	that's a shame
Nov 16 15:21:37 .:NorrinRadd:.	i get that feeling almost everywhere i go though. same as you, i don't get it
Nov 16 15:21:59 .:sysRPL:.	i guess people feel if they don't post it, it didn't happen
Nov 16 15:22:45 .:sysRPL:.	i have been writing code and building electronics projects for decades
Nov 16 15:23:22 .:sysRPL:.	yet i do not own a mobile phone, i don't text, and i don't use facebook or twitter, or any of that crap
Nov 16 15:23:46 .:X7:.	I wish I could live without a mobile phone. But alas, I need one if I'm to hold a job down of any kind.
Nov 16 15:24:12 .:sysRPL:.	X7: i can understand that
Nov 16 15:24:40 .:sysRPL:.	yesterday my SO wanted to eat a steak and shake $4 hamburger meal
Nov 16 15:24:53 .:live1:.	thinking of going no phone or "dumbphone" for some time now... it's just a matter of time. decision is health first, distraction and privacy second.
Nov 16 15:25:21 .:sysRPL:.	the drive thru operator had their mobile phone out on the counter and spent more time using it versus working
Nov 16 15:25:39 .:X7:.	I don't think "dumbphones" exist anymore. They're meant for seniors that don't want to get involved with android and even then, the flip phone is powered by android under the hood.
Nov 16 15:25:59 .:sysRPL:.	X7: plenty of dumb phones still exists
Nov 16 15:26:11 .:sysRPL:.	X7: most burner phones are dumb phones
Nov 16 15:26:22 .:jim:.	sysRPL, so you['re old(er) school
Nov 16 15:26:55 .:NorrinRadd:.	i'm a little off myself too. i go as far as telling people i don't have a phone. The truth is, it never leave my side, but i don't use it as a phone though. for me it's a mobile computer. and i have zero interest using it as a phone unless i need to
Nov 16 15:27:48 .:NorrinRadd:.	and i really only care to use anonymous social media
Nov 16 15:28:20 .:X7:.	Since nobody uses facebook anymore and twitter is on fire, I can safely not use any social media of any kind.
Nov 16 15:28:21 .:NorrinRadd:.	as soon as too many people IRL start following me, that'll be the last message i post.  on to a new account or network
Nov 16 15:28:23 .:sysRPL:.	jim: sure
Nov 16 15:28:42 .:live1:.	too bad majority of people is on the "other side" (facebook, insta......)
Nov 16 15:29:34 .:jim:.	sysRPL, interesting, I'm trying to learn electronics; right now struggling with the quantum stuff that underlies semiconductors
Nov 16 15:30:03 .:sysRPL:.	jim: so like doping?
Nov 16 15:30:12 .:jim:.	yeah
Nov 16 15:30:40 .:ozgur:.	we are still happy here and must not take the time to social media to learn new info knowledge.
Nov 16 15:30:42 .:jim:.	and like how the conduction works in various situations, such as a diode junction
Nov 16 15:30:58 .:sysRPL:.	jim: i think that's more chemistry rather than qm
Nov 16 15:31:24 .:jim:.	sure
Nov 16 15:31:45 .:jim:.	I never took chemestry
Nov 16 15:32:59 .:djph:.	jim: don't worry yourself over the physics, lol :)
Nov 16 15:33:19 .:djph:.	unles that's the point of your education
Nov 16 15:33:44 .:sysRPL:.	i am more interested in voltages, circuits, dsp, and digital protocols like spi and i2c
Nov 16 15:33:48 .:jim:.	djph, no, studying physics is not fun for me
Nov 16 15:34:23 .:djph:.	jim: heh, so then don't worry about it :)  just know that things like diodes only work one way and you're good :)
Nov 16 15:34:41 .:jim:.	I could do it as "0.7v to turn on a transistor? done!"
Nov 16 15:35:38 .:live1:.	EE is fine, then digital logic
Nov 16 15:36:17 .:jim:.	back in a bit...
Nov 16 15:36:19 .:thyriaen:.	X7, I have a leftover stack of Essential PH-1s as burner phones
Nov 16 15:36:28 .:thyriaen:.	sysRPL,
Nov 16 15:37:03 .:sysRPL:.	thylacine: okay
Nov 16 15:44:24 .:live1:.	happy hacking everybody :^)
Nov 16 15:51:53 .:djph:.	jim: yep, that's kind of all you need to worry about :)
Nov 16 16:28:07 .:Hypfer:.	hi everyone, I'm currently trying to build a module for an existing vendor kernel from other sources. Specifically, I'm trying to build the zram module.
Nov 16 16:28:34 .:Hypfer:.	As the vendor kernel does not feature "lzo1x_decompress_safe", I'd like to build with "CONFIG_LZO_DECOMPRESS=m", however every time i run make modules, it changes the .config file back to =y
Nov 16 16:28:54 .:Hypfer:.	how do I make it not do that?
Nov 16 16:30:41 .:rascul:.	can it be built as a module?
Nov 16 16:34:46 .:Hypfer:.	https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/LZ4_DECOMPRESS.html I'd assume that type:tristate means y/n/m
Nov 16 16:36:28 .:rascul:.	it might be that you have something it depends on with a y instead of a m
Nov 16 16:36:34 .:rascul:.	or something that depends on it
Nov 16 16:38:55 .:Hypfer:.	yes thank you!

Nov 16 17:09:56 .:lericson:.	hi friends, in a bash script, can I wait for a particular command to finish and then signal all children? iirc you can send a signal to the process group or something
Nov 16 17:12:38 .:maxim120x:.	hi
Nov 16 17:17:01 .:lolok:.	lericson you may have better luck asking in #bash for something that specific
Nov 16 17:17:14 .:ananke:.	lericson: uhmm, there's a lot to unpack. for starters, if it's an actual _child_ process, it can't exist once the parent dies
Nov 16 17:17:36 .:ananke:.	lericson: so you wouldn't be able to wait for the parent to finish and then hope to signal its childre
Nov 16 17:17:39 .:ananke:.	n
Nov 16 17:19:33 .:ananke:.	(now, they don't die instantly, the OS kills them, but that's not really relevant in this case)
Nov 16 17:22:16 .:lericson:.	ananke: in script.sh, job1 & job2 & job3; <send INT to job1 and job2 when reaching this line>
Nov 16 17:23:13 .:lericson:.	and i think the parent can die without the child dying by the way, but it's not what i'm asking
Nov 16 17:24:00 .:live1:.	lericson: pidof(job1), pidof(job2), pidof(job3)... kill <pid1>, <pid2>, <pid3>... ?
Nov 16 17:24:18 .:live1:.	eg. get pid of process, send signal ?
Nov 16 17:24:28 .:lericson:.	live1: certainly possible but i was hoping there'd be a better way
Nov 16 17:24:52 .:live1:.	i think there is a way to get all children from a process....
Nov 16 17:25:24 .:ananke:.	lericson: those are not actual child processes
Nov 16 17:29:09 .:ananke:.	lericson: here you can find some pointers, more in line with what you're doing: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/392022/whats-the-best-way-to-send-a-signal-to-all-members-of-a-process-group
Nov 16 17:32:33 .:lericson:.	I'm going with pkill -INT -P $$
Nov 16 17:34:05 .:lericson:.	i like the part about kill -$$ killing the kill process before completing the job
Nov 16 17:34:21 .:lericson:.	actually i guess that only happens if you list the pids
Nov 16 17:35:24 .:BluesKaj:.	Hi all
Nov 16 17:35:24 .:kurahaupo_:.	lericson: The killpg system call is atomic, so unless you're calling it more than once it's difficult to see how that could be an issue

Nov 16 18:00:01 .:OutOfService:.	Hi!
Nov 16 18:00:03 .:OutOfService:.	I'm fighting with ipxe, and dhcp options in order to config a boot menu and be able to install different distros. My dns server is dnsmasq (the one in my router) and I'm a little lost with some options that I cant understand. Something like dhcp-match=set:ipxe,175 - dhcp-vendorclass=set:bios,PXEClient:Arch:00000  -  pxe-service=tag:loadbios,x86PC,"iPXE Network boot (BIOS)",undionly.kpxe  and
Nov 16 18:00:03 .:OutOfService:.	etc....  I've read the dnsmasq man page in https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html, but I cant understand most of these options. Please, someone could help me to find good documentation so that I can learn how dhcp options work?
Nov 16 18:00:35 .:Dagmar:.	DHCP options aren't for that
Nov 16 18:00:42 .:Dagmar:.	Theyr'e also documented in the RFC
Nov 16 18:01:06 .:koollman_:.	they can be for pretty much anything as long as the client uses them, though
Nov 16 18:01:13 .:ali_:.	I find memory leakes on many coreutils source codes. Is acceptable to solvind and sending patch to it's maling list ? I don't know what is good PR and patch for a open source project. How can I understand it ?
Nov 16 18:01:17 .:hodapp:.	Dagmar: couldn't save anything if I can't interact with any apps
Nov 16 18:01:41 .:OutOfService:.	Dagmar i have to use these options depending of my client arch, like efi or bios... for example. Everyone takes a different file to boot from
Nov 16 18:02:16 .:Dagmar:.	Yes, everyone can get a different file to boot from because of the way they _search the PXE server_
Nov 16 18:02:36 .:Dagmar:.	You demanding DHCP options will not make them magically spring into existence or change what they do
Nov 16 18:02:46 .:Dagmar:.	That's literally not what they do
Nov 16 18:04:14 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: you probably should split your problems into smaller problems. I suppose you are using ipxe through pxe. So, you have something that boots, and load ipxe image already ?
Nov 16 18:04:24 .:OutOfService:.	I think the menu i'm building is working fine now, but I cant stop my project and go witouth learning these kind of things.. I'm not happy till I understand how these options work... averythin related to tags, for example. Do you know a good documentation ÇI could have a look at?
Nov 16 18:06:23 .:Dagmar:.	Tags are typically attached to clothing with little plastic cables
Nov 16 18:06:46 .:OutOfService:.	https://gist.github.com/rikka0w0/50895b82cbec8a3a1e8c7707479824c1  - > chapter 4, as an example
Nov 16 18:07:00 .:OutOfService:.	I'd love to understand how to use these options
Nov 16 18:07:25 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: you can think of dhcp options as numbers and associated values with convention-defined meanings. Many are common to multiple dhcp clients, some are very specific. Those options are likely only useful for ipxe
Nov 16 18:07:32 .:OutOfService:.	or here: https://github.com/mbirth/ipxe-config/blob/master/dnsmasq.d/pxeproxy.conf
Nov 16 18:07:41 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: so you could read about those in ipxe documentation
Nov 16 18:08:16 .:OutOfService:.	koollman_ Actually ÇI didn't find any good documentation on ipxe project website
Nov 16 18:08:27 .:Dagmar:.	The simplest solution is to just put make a symlink for what the client device looks for first
Nov 16 18:08:33 .:Dagmar:.	Like, turn on logging for the TFTP server
Nov 16 18:08:55 .:OutOfService:.	yhes, I'm using tcpdump in my router
Nov 16 18:09:09 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: you should get something working without dhcp options at first
Nov 16 18:09:11 .:Dagmar:.	And again, I'm going to say, read the RFC for DHCP
Nov 16 18:09:13 »»	ChanServ sets modes (#linux +o litharge)
Nov 16 18:09:14 »»	litharge sets modes (#linux -bo *!*tristan_@106.208.78.4 litharge)
Nov 16 18:09:16 .:Dagmar:.	It's freakin' short
Nov 16 18:09:19 .:koollman_:.	(beside the obvious tftp one)
Nov 16 18:09:26 .:koollman_:.	Dagmar: I'm not sure how that helps :)
Nov 16 18:09:42 .:Dagmar:.	koollman_: It's shorter than any book he's going to wade through
Nov 16 18:09:54 .:koollman_:.	but it will not discuss non-standard dhcp options
Nov 16 18:09:56 .:Dagmar:.	It also explains everything you'd want to know about DHCP option declarations
Nov 16 18:09:59 .:koollman_:.	since, well ... non-standard
Nov 16 18:10:08 .:Dagmar:.	Whatever people are doing with non-standard DHCP options is on them
Nov 16 18:10:27 .:Dagmar:.	Whatever is _consuming_ those options should have documentation that explains what they're doing with those
Nov 16 18:10:31 .:OutOfService:.	Dagmar I think I already read the rfc. I didn't find anythong related to tags, for example. Maybe I didn't get the correct rfc, but I couldn't finde it on it
Nov 16 18:11:22 .:Dagmar:.	So why can't you turn logging up on the TFTP server?
Nov 16 18:11:39 .:Dagmar:.	...because for CERTAIN it'll be easier to read than the output of tcpdump.
Nov 16 18:11:45 .:OutOfService:.	Dagmar I did. dnsmasq logging
Nov 16 18:11:56 .:koollman_:.	ipxe lacks some simpler/searchable documentation last time I looked at it
Nov 16 18:12:08 .:Dagmar:.	Okay, I'm out.  I've had enough of saying "Do X" and seeing "OKay, now I'm doing Y"
Nov 16 18:12:59 .:OutOfService:.	Dagmar tftp works inside dnsmasq, so the logging is the same for both
Nov 16 18:13:06 .:koollman_:.	here's probably the best non-finished documentation on existing ipxe options (and why some configs use them) : https://ipxe.org/appnote/premature
Nov 16 18:13:39 .:koollman_:.	but really you probably don't need those in most situations
Nov 16 18:13:54 .:koollman_:.	you can start with something simpler from this : https://ipxe.org/howto/chainloading
Nov 16 18:15:54 .:OutOfService:.	koollman_, thanks. But what I'd like is to learn how to undertand these options. Actually my menu project is already working. But I don´t like to finish it and keep so much doubts about how it works.. Thats why I want to understand these dhcp options
Nov 16 18:16:03 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: but, basically, you usually have some existing pxe implementation preloaded in the machine booting. So, you first need a 'normal' pxe setup to send it ipxe. Then, ipxe will make another request, and obviously if you send it ipxe again, well, it loops
Nov 16 18:16:07 .:OutOfService:.	I'm sorry for my english. Its hard for me to explain correctly
Nov 16 18:17:08 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: so you need some ways to differentiate between ipxe and some other random pxe implementation. One way to do that is to set an option that only ipxe will use, or to test the dhcp request
Nov 16 18:17:16 .:OutOfService:.	yes, the config file it takes just after ipke.efi bin is a config file chaining to the http server in order to take all the remaining files...
Nov 16 18:17:20 .:lnxtux:.	hI
Nov 16 18:18:19 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: I am not sure there's a complete documentation of ipxe options. You can guess some of it from the premature doc I linked before
Nov 16 18:18:43 .:koollman_:.	but basically, they are just numbers with predefined meaning, used to pass informations
Nov 16 18:19:43 .:OutOfService:.	yes, I've already read these doc, but IMHO it's quite bad and incomplete... Anyway, I think none of you can understand what I want. I think I should improve my english.. :S
Nov 16 18:19:54 .:OutOfService:.	Thanks for your help anyway :)
Nov 16 18:20:23 .:koollman_:.	oh, there's also https://ipxe.org/howto/dhcpd ... but yes, it's not just your english, the documentations aren't very good for that :)
Nov 16 18:21:05 .:OutOfService:.	"<koollman_> but basically, they are just numbers with predefined meaning, used to pass informations" -> yes, this is what I mean.. And I think I need to find somewhere it's explained
Nov 16 18:21:45 .:koollman_:.	OutOfService: you could try #ipxe but not sure how useful it will be
Nov 16 18:22:08 .:OutOfService:.	So, you say that something like it (dhcp-vendorclass=set:bios,PXEClient:Arch:00000) is just for using with ipxe?
Nov 16 18:22:40 .:OutOfService:.	ohhhh, a great idea. I didn't try to open this channel hehe
Nov 16 18:23:06 .:koollman_:.	dhcp-vendorclass is more common, but its meaning varies with the actual client
Nov 16 18:23:16 .:OutOfService:.	thanks... I should have tried it before trying to ask here..
Nov 16 18:23:50 .:koollman_:.	but for example option 175 has no basic meaning and ipxe uses it to differentiate itself from other possible dhcp client
Nov 16 18:24:16 .:OutOfService:.	ok. and the way this option is written... or what means all the parts of that phfrase?
Nov 16 18:24:42 .:OutOfService:.	this is actually what i need and I can't find
Nov 16 18:24:55 .:OutOfService:.	how to write my own "dhcp-vendorclass=set:bios,PXEClient:Arch:00000", as an exaqmple
Nov 16 18:25:11 .:OutOfService:.	understand why these words are there, their order,m their meaning...
Nov 16 18:25:37 .:OutOfService:.	ot another example:
Nov 16 18:25:38 .:OutOfService:.	pxe-service=tag:loadefi32,BC_EFI,"iPXE Network boot (EFI32)",ipxe32.efi
Nov 16 18:26:26 .:OutOfService:.	I can image how it works... but if i have to create a new line like that by myself, I won't be able as I don't know the meaning of all it's parts
Nov 16 18:26:32 .:OutOfService:.	can you understand me now?
Nov 16 18:26:37 .:Dagmar:.	...and since most PXE clients will start by searching for an image that has their MAC address in the filename, I've never once needed to try to pass any further options to a PXE-enabled device
Nov 16 18:28:27 .:falsifiability:.	I try to set an Environment var in a bash script by doing "ENVVAR=$(some command)". I want that the ENVVAR is "" if the command fails. how would i do that? When just doing the command and it exits with an error code (e.g. 2) the whole execution stops...
Nov 16 18:29:08 .:phonixgeist:.	Hey guys... so.. I'm getting this error on boot load for a monitor connected to HDMI... this is an hybrid (gpu) laptop... I found this on journalctl """"kernel: nvidia-modeset: ERROR: GPU:0: The requested configuration of display devices (Samsung LF27T35 (HDMI-0), VGA-0) is not supported on this GPU.""""
Nov 16 18:29:15 .:phonixgeist:.	any ideas what could it be???
Nov 16 18:30:16 .:Dagmar:.	That whatever you configured it to do isn't possible
Nov 16 18:30:44 .:Dagmar:.	Also that the hybrid chipset machines are a f**king nightmare to work with
Nov 16 18:32:04 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: Undo wherever you set the bash setting that causes it to exit when some subshell gets an error
Nov 16 18:32:17 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: That is _not_ the default behaviour
Nov 16 18:32:18 .:phonixgeist:.	Dagmar, I haven't configured anything... i was playing with xorg.conf but did not worked... so I delete the file and did a clean reinstall of all gpu drivers...
Nov 16 18:32:30 .:Dagmar:.	This isn't windows
Nov 16 18:32:39 .:Dagmar:.	Reinstalling a bunch of packages never fixes random problems
Nov 16 18:32:47 .:aarktica:.	I just lost access to my desktop after starting virt-manager. I have SDDM installed. When I log in, the system appears to start the login process before returning me to the prompt. Issuing 'startxfce' as root works, though; the issue is that I can't get the display to run as regular user. How can I troubleshoot this issue?
Nov 16 18:33:05 .:Dagmar:.	The only problems it will ever solve under Linux are when something went terribly wrong and installing the packages somehow failed at simple tasks like writing to the filesystem
Nov 16 18:33:18 .:falsifiability:.	Dagmar: I see. It is a nixos systemd service configured in the configuration.nix. I think it sets +e or something. Thanks for the hint!
Nov 16 18:33:22 .:Dagmar:.	...and usually the machine is very obviously trying to die when that happens
Nov 16 18:33:23 .:Elw3:.	I would not say never :D
Nov 16 18:33:26 .:phonixgeist:.	Dagmar, yes I know... I did so many changes that wasnt sure that I undo all the changes... so.. just delete all and install it again...
Nov 16 18:33:59 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: I've only got like, hundreds of shell scripts that check the error status of subcommands, and none of those die off until I let them

Nov 16 18:34:53 .:phonixgeist:.	or not always?
Nov 16 18:35:08 .:falsifiability:.	Dagmar: Just checked. nixos sets "set -e" for systemd script, which means: "Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status" :)
Nov 16 18:35:13 .:Dagmar:.	aarktica: How did you "start" virt-manager that it could have possibly made any changes to your desktop?
Nov 16 18:35:27 .:Dagmar:.	aarktica: It's literally just another app, not significantly different from starting Chrome or something
Nov 16 18:35:50 .:lericson:.	falsifiability: that makes nerds angry

Nov 16 18:36:49 .:falsifiability:.	I mean... it could make sense to fail if any command fails... but it would not be my first assumption. Well... now I know :D
Nov 16 18:37:11 .:Dagmar:.	aarktica: I'm gonna suggest that whatever is going on with the display manager doesn't ahve anything to do with virt-manager under normal circumstances
Nov 16 18:37:12 .:lericson:.	the idea is good, it's just set -e doesn't do what you think it does
Nov 16 18:37:49 .:lericson:.	or rather, shell scripts are not very well designed wrt control flow and set -e just makes that obvious
Nov 16 18:38:01 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: In general, it does _not_ make sense to ask the shell to do that for you, and if you set it system-wide it will *break* a lot of perfectly normal scripts that _expect_ some things to fail and deal with that appropriately
Nov 16 18:38:37 .:Dagmar:.	Responsible adults write code that checks the exit status of any and all external commands they run, and write code that _handles those scenarios_
Nov 16 18:39:08 .:Dagmar:.	Children and simpletons use set -e by default
Nov 16 18:39:59 .:ayecee:.	turn down the bombast please.
Nov 16 18:40:11 .:Dagmar:.	The only time one would normally tell the shell to die from any errors would be in one's own script because they actually just don't want the script to continue
Nov 16 18:40:17 .:Dagmar:.	...which is kinda lazy
Nov 16 18:42:09 .:falsifiability:.	It is not set system wide afaik. just if you want a systemd unit that executes your own script.
Nov 16 18:43:01 .:aarktica:.	Dagmar: Agreed about virt-manager. Whatever happened is probably independent of that program. It's just that firing up that app was immediately followed by being tossed back to the login prompt.
Nov 16 18:43:30 .:Dagmar:.	aarktica: I'd try and replicate it.  Reboot, do it again, see if the same thing happens
Nov 16 18:43:36 .:Dagmar:.	It probably _won't_
Nov 16 18:44:31 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: Allow me to suggest that this is not a thing you should change even systemd-wide
Nov 16 18:45:05 .:Dagmar:.	falsifiability: I don't have a very high opinion of the people working on systemd at all, but there's no telling how many support scripts in systemd you might be breaking by flipping that switch
Nov 16 18:45:11 .:falsifiability:.	I wont... i will change it for those lines of the script where i want a specific behaviour.
Nov 16 18:45:24 .:Dagmar:.	Okay, _that_ is a reasonable use of the setting
Nov 16 18:45:42 .:falsifiability:.	:)
Nov 16 18:45:51 .:Dagmar:.	...although *do* consider just checking if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then
Nov 16 18:46:10 .:Dagmar:.	It's always considered better to give a coherent error message before exiting
Nov 16 18:46:19 .:aarktica:.	Dagmar: Will reboot shortly.
Nov 16 18:46:37 .:Dagmar:.	Anything that exits due to an error should set their exit status to something other than zero, which means $? will contain something other than zero
Nov 16 18:47:03 .:falsifiability:.	I would do a check of the result anyways afterward - did just not get that far because it died on me before :D

Nov 16 20:31:54 .:koollman_:.	media servers tend to end up with more mixed usage beside just recording large media
Nov 16 20:32:18 .:jim:.	so the industry is presenting us with older teechnology, that's cheaper for them to make
Nov 16 20:32:23 .:koollman_:.	even writing, say, a bunch of audio files, would already be in 'slower than cmr' category (not that it would matter much)
Nov 16 20:32:23 .:ayecee:.	no
Nov 16 20:32:33 .:koollman_:.	jim: not older. different
Nov 16 20:32:53 .:koollman_:.	and, yes, cheaper for the same size, usually
Nov 16 20:33:18 .:koollman_:.	and if they were marketed as such, it would rarely be a problem, really
Nov 16 20:33:34 .:jim:.	well otherwise the manuf. would consider that a failure, and not produce them
Nov 16 20:33:44 .:ayecee:.	cheaper to make, cheaper to buy. when they were a new thing, some unwitting consumers saw the price tag and didn't ask.
Nov 16 20:33:54 .:koollman_:.	ayecee: vendors lied, too :)
Nov 16 20:34:07 .:ayecee:.	jim: that's not how manufacturing works.
Nov 16 20:34:08 .:koollman_:.	wether directly or by omission
Nov 16 20:34:43 .:koollman_:.	"here's the new model, you can use it instead. also it is cheaper!" ... but it turns out, you cannot use it as direct replacement of the old model in various situations
Nov 16 20:34:49 .:ayecee:.	koollman_: i reckon some of them also saw the price tag and didn't ask.
Nov 16 20:34:54 .:koollman_:.	and you ended up discovering that at a bad time, of course
Nov 16 20:36:29 .:ayecee:.	fwiw random reads are fine too, it's the random writes where they're not so performant. the average home user probably wouldn't even notice the difference except in their wallet.
Nov 16 20:36:58 .:koollman_:.	which is why vendors quietly changed their offering. Works as long as no one notice :)
Nov 16 20:37:27 .:ayecee:.	sure, and they pass that reduced price to the customers, since the customers are a very price sensitive lot
Nov 16 20:37:29 .:koollman_:.	but then someone read "well, for this freenas server you want wd red nas, cause that's good for it", and they use them ...
Nov 16 20:37:43 .:koollman_:.	and well, the first zfs resilvering makes them think "wow, zfs is awful"
Nov 16 20:38:03 .:koollman_:.	while in fact, using previous gen wd red nas drives would have worked perfectly
Nov 16 20:38:19 .:ayecee:.	oh, there's wd red smr?
Nov 16 20:38:35 .:koollman_:.	well, no. they were called wd red nas. you see. :)
Nov 16 20:38:36 .:ayecee:.	so there is
Nov 16 20:39:01 .:koollman_:.	and if you do not know, even trying to find decent advice would get you in a problematic situation
Nov 16 20:39:17 .:ayecee:.	aha, now they sell the CMR as wd red plus
Nov 16 20:39:19 .:koollman_:.	because ... well, vendor will not tell it kept the name but changed the tech
Nov 16 20:39:52 .:bindi:.	WD >=8TB should be CMR if you wanna be 100% sure (in the case of shucking externals for example)
Nov 16 20:40:29 .:koollman_:.	so now there are list of 'known cmr' and 'known smr' models. which is sad, because it really should be obvious to the buyer, at least when buying the disk separately
Nov 16 20:40:48 .:ayecee:.	weird
Nov 16 20:41:10 .:koollman_:.	(it was mostly bad in 2020. it's slowly getting better)
Nov 16 20:41:24 .:ayecee:.	looks that way, from https://www.anandtech.com/show/15878/western-digital-cleans-up-the-red-smr-nas-hdd-mess
Nov 16 20:41:46 .:ayecee:.	vanilla reds are now all smr, red plus is cmr, red pro is cmr at 7200rpm.
Nov 16 20:41:58 .:koollman_:.	yep. Still, it shouldn't even have happened in the first place
Nov 16 20:42:02 .:ayecee:.	nod
Nov 16 20:42:55 .:koollman_:.	which is why many caring about storage get wary of the actual tech used and stay clear from smr in most situations
Nov 16 20:43:04 .:ayecee:.	missed opportunity. instead of smr being desirable as high capacity at low price, it's despised by a very vocal set.
Nov 16 20:43:17 .:koollman_:.	while they could have been introduced with user knowledge and desirable properties
Nov 16 20:44:36 .:blackop:.	hi

Nov 16 20:54:27 .:tlf:.	koollman_: will do. Best I have so far is a script from here https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/700077/use-midi-signals-for-media-control
Nov 16 20:55:24 .:ayecee:.	i'm not sure what the difference is between /dev/midi and /dev/sequencer, but i bet there's a difference.
Nov 16 20:56:01 .:ayecee:.	also this page refers to OSS, so i suppose it might be a bit dated.
Nov 16 20:56:30 .:tlf:.	ah, yes, possibly. alsa supports MIDI at the moment so no need for jack at least
Nov 16 20:58:21 .:ayecee:.	getting the data from alsa looks more.. alsa-ish, like in this example https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/articles/linuxmidi/alsa-1.0/alsarawmidiin.c
Nov 16 20:59:01 .:ayecee:.	like, using snd_rawmidi_open and a portname of hw:1,0,0 in this example.
Nov 16 20:59:37 .:tlf:.	Thanks ayecee. Iĺl dabble with that. I´ve also got that script working which might make koollman_ happy
Nov 16 21:00:49 .:ayecee:.	huh, i also see a reference to aseqview, which can show received events. don't know if that's still a thing.
Nov 16 21:00:53 .:tlf:.	koollman_: I had to change line 21 index from 0 to 1 to get at my USB device (0 seems to be some kind of default or virtual midi device). YMMV.
Nov 16 21:02:35 .:tlf:.	nice find ayecee, I see some repos for it from 2021. looks promising

Nov 16 23:24:13 .:ayecee:.	i would also say 1-2GB
Nov 16 23:24:22 .:uwharrie:.	hsv: or skip the partition completely and use a swap file instead
Nov 16 23:24:32 .:Sauvin:.	I might even venture to say 5GB if you run lots of memory-intensive stuff.
Nov 16 23:25:00 .:ayecee:.	like if you're the type that leaves 100 chrome tabs open

Nov 16 23:28:39 .:ayecee:.	sauvin: swap wouldn't do a lot of good for that one though, unless the matrix just barely fit in that 48gb of ram.
Nov 16 23:29:15 .:ayecee:.	not a lot of cold spots in the matrix to swap out.
Nov 16 23:29:23 .:Sauvin:.	I said "matrices", and I believe if it's not a single matrix, yes, I believe swap would help.
Nov 16 23:29:31 .:SoF:.	how would a mere 5GB help if 48GB is not enough?
Nov 16 23:29:53 .:ayecee:.	SoF: how do you mean
Nov 16 23:30:20 .:Sauvin:.	SoF, even when memory is almost untouched, I believe the kernel uses swap to park areas of memory that haven't been touched recently if swap is available.
Nov 16 23:30:25 .:brjl:.	SoF: If his matrices use 52GB of RAM, for example :þ
Nov 16 23:30:28 .:hsv:.	It will have a RAID-0 array.  The first physical disk accomodates /boot partition, so i was thinking let the other disks each have a same size partition striped for swap, with the remainder for /.  That way raid 0 operates across equal size partitions.
Nov 16 23:30:33 .:SoF:.	fair enough
Nov 16 23:30:50 .:Sauvin:.	Memory management on Linux systems ain't simple.
Nov 16 23:30:52 .:CrtxReavr:.	raid0 is really not a good idea.
Nov 16 23:30:57 .:CrtxReavr:.	But you do you.
Nov 16 23:31:04 .:brjl:.	Memory management on any system is simple
Nov 16 23:31:23 .:ayecee:.	hsv: i don't expect that swap would be a high traffic area here. there's no reason to dedicate a partition to it like that.
Nov 16 23:31:34 .:hsv:.	CrtxReavr: because one failure takes them all down?
Nov 16 23:31:46 .:CrtxReavr:.	Indeed.
Nov 16 23:32:16 .:CrtxReavr:.	ayecee, you're not advocating a swap file over a swap partition, are you?
Nov 16 23:32:31 .:ayecee:.	aren't i?
Nov 16 23:32:43 .:CrtxReavr:.	That's not a good plan.
Nov 16 23:32:52 .:ayecee:.	you're not a good plan.
Nov 16 23:33:22 .:CrtxReavr:.	The reason linux supports a swap partition, is because you want your access to swap to be fast, and the swap partiion elliminates the filesystem calls from the equation.
Nov 16 23:33:47 .:din0:.	i use a ram disk for my swap partition bigbrain time
Nov 16 23:33:52 .:ayecee:.	the reason that's irrelevant is that swap is going to be barely used on this system instead of frequently used like when you developed this opinion.
Nov 16 23:34:29 .:CrtxReavr:.	din0, that's a whole different catagory of fail.
Nov 16 23:34:34 .:din0:.	haha
Nov 16 23:34:34 .:ssm_:.	I mean it's not like some days you're going to want swap and other days not, a partition just makes more sense for something permanent
Nov 16 23:35:04 .:hsv:.	I have 3 or more 450GB SAS drives, so allocating /boot to the first drive and now they are unequal in size.
Nov 16 23:35:05 .:ayecee:.	figure you'll always want the same size too?
Nov 16 23:35:30 .:uwharrie:.	pretty sure the kernel bypasses most of the VFS layer for swap files
Nov 16 23:35:38 .:RayTracer:.	hsv: you could make /boot raid1 with 3 members :)
Nov 16 23:35:39 .:Bahhumbug:.	It bypasses all of it.
Nov 16 23:35:49 .:Bahhumbug:.	swapfiles have been treated like partitions for many years now.
Nov 16 23:36:12 .:ayecee:.	eh. feels like a bad match when the rest is raid0.
Nov 16 23:36:15 .:CrtxReavr:.	I know Windows does. . . not sure about linux.
Nov 16 23:36:31 .:ayecee:.	this is a yolo array.
Nov 16 23:36:49 .:hsv:.	RayTracer: it crossed my mind, but hardly any point since the main partition is unrecoverable if a single disk goes down.
Nov 16 23:36:54 .:RayTracer:.	ayecee: hey, isn't the job done already when kernel is ready in initrd? :D
Nov 16 23:37:40 .:RayTracer:.	ok I'll keep the kidding for myself for some time
Nov 16 23:40:03 .:ayecee:.	didn't even really make sense back in the day either. filesystem operations weren't _that_ expensive. we just loved our micro optimizations.
Nov 16 23:40:47 .:ayecee:.	having it as a partition was an easy way to ensure it was contiguous at least.
Nov 16 23:42:10 .:ayecee:.	but even that doesn't seem like much use for a case where random non-sequential access is the norm
Nov 16 23:58:13 .:ayecee:.	I could see a benefit in a kernel developer choosing partition over file, to avoid conflating unrelated problems while working on memory management or filesystem code.
Nov 17 00:00:07 .:ayecee:.	where "filesystem overhead" means more pieces they'd have to consider when tracking down a problem.
Nov 17 00:03:08 .:CrtxReavr:.	When I used to have to build multi-boot images, including linux, I would always go with a swap file, in order to save on primary partition slots.
Nov 17 00:03:16 .:epony:.	conflating is an irc term ;-)
Nov 17 00:03:24 .:epony:.	nothing like that in computing
Nov 17 00:03:29 .:koollman_:.	that was back when partitions slots were rare :)
Nov 17 00:03:43 .:CrtxReavr:.	In MBR, they certainly could be.
Nov 17 00:03:55 .:superkuh:.	MBR4LIFE.
Nov 17 00:03:58 .:CrtxReavr:.	GPT is friendlier, in that respect.
Nov 17 00:04:03 .:epony:.	ayecee, get back to technically accurate talk, instead of social chitchat mode
Nov 17 00:04:07 .:ayecee:.	conflating is an english term, but might be a 10 dolla word when a shorter one would suffice.
Nov 17 00:04:09 .:xiaomiao:.	CrtxReavr: why not lvm then
Nov 17 00:04:11 .:superkuh:.	I boot MBR on GPT formatted drives.
Nov 17 00:04:36 .:ayecee:.	epony: i value your feedback and your suggestions for a better word.
Nov 17 00:05:00 .:koollman_:.	the other usage was to have somewhat-working suspend-to-disk. suspend-to-file took a while to work even half-reliably :)
Nov 17 00:05:19 .:CrtxReavr:.	xiaomiao, that didn't help when building. . . say a single HD image that would boot Windows, Linux, & Solaris.
Nov 17 00:05:30 .:superkuh:.	I wonder if I still can only have 4 partitions with MBR on GPT.
Nov 17 00:05:36 .:superkuh:.	I've been assuming so.
Nov 17 00:05:37 .:epony:.	file systems are not "a developer" choosings, they are multi-year efforts of many people of technical challenges with hard disks and other storage devices topology and physical controller and medium implementations
Nov 17 00:06:05 .:koollman_:.	superkuh: mbr has exactly the same limits as before. But don't bother, use gpt :)
Nov 17 00:06:06 .:CrtxReavr:.	superkuh, probably only 4 bootable. . . sure you can mount others, once you boot the kernel, etc.
Nov 17 00:06:09 .:ayecee:.	"a developer" may triage a filesystem bug.
Nov 17 00:06:18 .:superkuh:.	koolazer, your confused. GPT drives can boot MBR.
Nov 17 00:06:21 .:superkuh:.	Er, you're.
Nov 17 00:06:23 .:koollman_:.	reasonably, 3 bootables, one extended :)

Nov 17 00:06:40 .:epony:.	it's as critical as you can suppose it to be, with machine dependent and machine independent separatioon as with most other system programming details
Nov 17 00:06:40 .:superkuh:.	Christ, lotta typos.
Nov 17 00:06:50 .:koollman_:.	I know that. I'm just discussing partition tables format
Nov 17 00:06:53 .:CrtxReavr:.	koollman_, no. . . you can create 4 bootable.
Nov 17 00:06:57 .:superkuh:.	Ok.
Nov 17 00:06:58 .:ayecee:.	epony: this is a lot of words to say very little.
Nov 17 00:07:03 .:koollman_:.	CrtxReavr: yes. but then you're kinda stuck :)
Nov 17 00:07:45 .:CrtxReavr:.	My mad multiboot skills are rather worthless in the age of virtualization.
Nov 17 00:08:09 .:ayecee:.	epony: i think you have confused verbosity with perspicacity.

Guys i got another off the wall question. why would somebody build a custom kenrel if the default one enables almost everything out there for newer systems? is it just to learn or say that you know how to build a kernel ? don't the distro maintainers update the kernel and you just update?
Nov 17 00:25:09 .:koollman_:.	definitely. I sometimes wonder about creating my own, better distro, with minimalistic tools and services. But then I remember how lazy I am. Lazy beats angry

Nov 17 01:16:00 .:hodapp:.	this is like the 4th part that server has fried in as many months
Nov 17 01:16:33 .:ayecee:.	yikes
Nov 17 01:17:05 .:hodapp:.	and someone *just* finished resilvering its ZFS pool after a disk failed, like 12 hours ago
Nov 17 01:17:23 .:jensen:.	is enabling SMART via bios or software something that should only be reserved for diagnosis perhaps because it does something in the background that is maybe cpu intensive or constantly polling data from hardware or is it completely safe/lightweight/harmless to enable all the time even if you only need some information once in a blue moon? e.g. apparently hdparm wakes the drives to check their state
Nov 17 01:17:25 .:jensen:.	and smartctl does not
Nov 17 01:17:39 .:jensen:.	i think smart is disabled by default in mobos for some reason
Nov 17 01:17:52 .:unknown_:.	yikes there bud
Nov 17 01:18:11 .:hodapp:.	last I checked, disks are collecting SMART data all the time regardless
Nov 17 01:18:14 .:hodapp:.	you just may not be using it
Nov 17 01:18:34 .:ayecee:.	nope. gotta enable it.
Nov 17 01:19:09 .:ayecee:.	jensen: it's completely safe/lightweight/harmless to enable all the time. it takes no cpu time. the statistics gathering is done by the drive.
Nov 17 01:19:38 .:jensen:.	ok, so smartd should be lightweight
Nov 17 01:19:53 .:ayecee:.	it is, but that's a separate thing.
Nov 17 01:20:01 .:lamar:.	hi
Nov 17 01:20:51 .:ayecee:.	as to why it defaults to disabled, i reckon there was some hardware at some point that did something unexpected when it was enabled.
Nov 17 01:21:15 .:jensen:.	i see
Nov 17 01:21:55 .:ayecee:.	like possibly reporting a failure in a situation where it wasn't failing or something.
Nov 17 02:01:56 .:WantToHelp:.	is there any special significance in bitwise logic to hex value 0xedb88320. I'm seeing it in sample CRC code. Thanks.
Nov 17 02:02:22 .:ayecee:.	seeing it where
Nov 17 02:02:43 .:WantToHelp:.	https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/#D-CRCAppendix
Nov 17 02:03:03 .:WantToHelp:.	in the make_crc_table function
Nov 17 02:05:06 .:ayecee:.	it's the generator polynomial for the crc-32 algorithm, as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check
Nov 17 02:05:43 .:ayecee:.	and i don't understand it either.
Nov 17 02:06:49 .:ayecee:.	"The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities", so i guess this is such a polynomial.
Nov 17 02:07:05 .:WantToHelp:.	i guess
Nov 17 02:11:20 .:puff:.	Good afternoon. Something is beeping every few seconds.  It's none of the usual suspects (slack/discord/google/chat/facebook messenger), is there any way to see what process is producing a sound?
Nov 17 02:11:46 .:puff:.	it's a quick three-down-two-up tone sequence.
Nov 17 02:11:49 .:Sauvin:.	Describe the beeping.
Nov 17 02:12:16 .:puff:.	Seems to occur 3-4 times, then stop for a few minutes, then happen again.
Nov 17 02:12:25 .:uwharrie:.	have you checked the batteries in your smoke detector?
Nov 17 02:12:54 .:puff:.	Hah.
Nov 17 02:13:13 .:puff:.	It's definitely coming from my laptop.  Fairly quiet though.
Nov 17 02:13:27 .:ayecee:.	huh. apparently there's some 7 common 32-bit polynomials, some offering better performance, i guess in terms of error detection capability.
Nov 17 02:14:16 .:Guest18:.	is it the usb device connect sound?
Nov 17 02:14:51 .:puff:.	Aha, yeah, it was.  Power brick was loose.
Nov 17 02:14:59 .:puff:.	Thanks.  That was getting a bit annoying.
Nov 17 02:15:06 .:Guest18:.	happens
Nov 17 02:15:20 .:puff:.	I still think there ought to be some way to list all such notificaitons.
Nov 17 02:15:24 .:puff:.	Not to mention a log of popups etc.
Nov 17 02:15:42 .:puff:.	Sometimes they'll pop up and then go away before I can read them.
Nov 17 02:16:21 .:puff:.	There was a gnome applet that would save a log file of the notifications but IIRC it got out of date.
Nov 17 02:16:39 .:phogg:.	puff: in theory if you run jackd, pulseaudio, or pipewire you can inspect the flow of audio through your system--but I don't know how to do it
Nov 17 02:16:43 .:NinthWave:.	Hello, looking for a FW update for an Intel serverboard.  Is it the right place ?
Nov 17 02:16:57 .:puff:.	I can do the notification thing from the shell, https://askubuntu.com/questions/105566/is-there-a-way-to-view-notification-history
Nov 17 02:17:02 .:phogg:.	NinthWave: we do not make or distribution firmware
Nov 17 02:17:14 .:puff:.	But I'd prefer something just built in, that runs always.
Nov 17 02:17:19 .:puff:.	phogg: Thanks.
Nov 17 02:18:05 .:puff:.	Ohwait, the notification service was in ubuntu and went away when they went back to gnome-shell.
Nov 17 02:18:15 .:NinthWave:.	@phogg any idea where I should look.  Intel has the bad habit of pulling files, unlike Supermicro
Nov 17 02:35:45 .:dexters:.	hey, could someone suggest a simple (NOT ARCH linux) distro?
Nov 17 02:36:20 .:hsv:.	Nothing is ever simple.  Nothing.
Nov 17 02:36:32 .:uwharrie:.	dexters: check out distrowatch.com
Nov 17 02:36:53 .:PastaComputer:.	Void Linux
Nov 17 02:38:55 .:mefistofeles:.	yeah, simple can have so many meanings, that's not easy to answer
Nov 17 02:39:16 .:mefistofeles:.	rather than meanings, interpretations
Nov 17 02:40:10 .:hsv:.	Is there any benefit to running swap on raid-0 vs. having separate swap partitions?
Nov 17 02:41:55 .:hsv:.	i mean, does linux make use of multiple swap partitions in some optimal way?
Nov 17 02:42:32 .:uwharrie:.	not in any meaningful way that you'd notice, so you'd best aim for simplicity and reliability
Nov 17 02:42:35 .:dexters:.	uwharrie: I was looking around there but found nothing that i really wanted.
Nov 17 02:42:54 .:uwharrie:.	dexters: guess that's it then
Nov 17 02:43:07 .:dexters:.	Ok
Nov 17 02:43:21 .:dexters:.	I might actually go with Void because it looks nice and it doesn't use SystemD
Nov 17 02:43:51 .:ummy:.	systemd does have its merits
Nov 17 02:44:53 .:dexters:.	musl or glibc?
Nov 17 02:45:38 .:ummy:.	musl broke a few programs in my experience dexters
Nov 17 02:45:38 .:uwharrie:.	yes? no? maybe?
Nov 17 02:45:58 .:ummy:.	if you want compatibility pick glibc
Nov 17 02:46:55 .:dexters:.	ok, glibc it is
Nov 17 02:49:25 .:PastaComputer:.	ummy: Like what
Nov 17 02:49:39 .:PastaComputer:.	(Genuine question) I've never explored Systemd's features that much
Nov 17 02:51:24 .:uwharrie:.	PastaComputer: the way it tracks processes and their children is an improvement compared to some of the old "stick a PID in a file" methods

Nov 17 02:59:56 .:ummy:.	PastaComputer there's also this thing called homed
Nov 17 03:00:17 .:PastaComputer:.	What is it?
Nov 17 03:00:34 .:ummy:.	its a systemd feature
Nov 17 03:00:54 .:PastaComputer:.	What does it do
Nov 17 03:01:14 .:ummy:.	it encrypts your home dir when you're not logged on or when your pc is asleep
Nov 17 03:01:32 .:ummy:.	it also allows you to put it on removable media
Nov 17 03:02:10 .:ummy:.	so if you stick it into a systemd machine with homed you can log on and go from there
Nov 17 03:02:14 .:ananke:.	encryption is optional, and it doesn't encrypt things 'when you're not logged in'
Nov 17 03:02:20 .:ummy:.	no?
Nov 17 03:02:26 .:PastaComputer:.	That's pretty neat sounding
Nov 17 03:02:40 .:uwharrie:.	what's the use case?
Nov 17 03:02:55 .:ananke:.	uwharrie: for homed?
Nov 17 03:03:23 .:uwharrie:.	yes. I assume it's the usual systemd multi-seat stuff
Nov 17 03:03:28 .:ananke:.	roaming
Nov 17 03:04:02 .:ummy:.	what ananke said
Nov 17 03:04:09 .:Foxboron:.	Lennart didnt like that there was no easy way to have a multi-user setup where /home dirs where decrypted upon login
Nov 17 03:04:28 .:Foxboron:.	The talk where he explains his personal usecase for it is neat.
Nov 17 03:05:06 .:ummy:.	systemd has some kind of multi-seat thing, right?
Nov 17 03:05:10 .:Foxboron:.	systemd also made early use of the cryptsetup token support for better and more user-friendly disk encryption with TPM/FIDO/PKCS11 support
Nov 17 03:05:30 .:Foxboron:.	ummy: I've never used any of the multi-seat stuff frankly
Nov 17 03:05:32 .:ananke:.	for example: you can have your home dir on a portable medium, and use it on an arbitrary system. so you can easily have your data on a work computer, then go home and use your other system
Nov 17 03:05:52 .:uwharrie:.	ummy: yes, that's where a lot of the polkit and user session stuff comes in
Nov 17 03:08:40 .:uwharrie:.	I could do the roaming home dir or the multiseat setup, but is there that big of a demand for either of them? I tend to not want my personal information floating around my work environment and I'm technically forbidden from having work materials accessible on personal devices.
Nov 17 03:09:56 .:Foxboron:.	People solve the problems they want to solve. "is there that big of a demand" has rarely shaped what people work on
Nov 17 03:12:40 .:ananke:.	not to mention, your particular requirements and situation may not be applicable to others
Nov 17 03:13:16 .:ummy:.	isn't the simplest solution always the best one?
Nov 17 03:13:30 .:ananke:.	no
Nov 17 03:13:38 .:kfrench:.	scratch that itch
Nov 17 03:14:15 .:ananke:.	'best' is a subjective measure, and requires articulated criteria
Nov 17 03:14:33 .:Foxboron:.	"Itch scratching" describes almost all F/OSS
Nov 17 03:16:40 .:kfrench:.	Foxboron: open sores?
Nov 17 03:17:16 .:ummy:.	if i needed to take work home with me as it were, would it be better to just have an encrypted volume on removable media
Nov 17 03:17:47 .:ummy:.	hypothetically
Nov 17 03:17:53 .:kfrench:.	best practice would be to bring home an entire work computer - not just the storage
Nov 17 03:18:00 .:ananke:.	ummy: and that's what homed can provide

Nov 17 03:20:52 .:qwertea:.	have any of you used escrow for freelancing deliverables?
Nov 17 03:21:21 .:qwertea:.	the deliverable is a sale, the sale needs to be closed for a fee.

Nov 17 03:40:44 .:qwertea:.	my pip install tensorflow expects bindings to a linux .so i think; but since python is running as an ipython instance in android NDK mode, its exposed to the java version of tensorflow which is bound to the .so

Nov 17 03:45:48 .:Sauvin:.	qwertea, this is a GNU/Linux channel. We know nothing of Android.
Nov 17 03:53:06 .:bdn:.	Hello! I've got a random question. On a standard GNU/Linux system, do I need to do anything to "protect" my `~/.ssh/` directory? It feels weird for apps to have access, as I would never voluntarily give potentially untrusted apps access to my SSH keys.
Nov 17 03:54:02 .:uwharrie:.	if you suspect an application of exfiltrating your private keys, why are you still running it?
Nov 17 03:54:16 .:kfrench:.	bdn: I don't think there's much you can do except keep the priv key encrypted.  You could set up some sort of fine-grained selinux policies too.
Nov 17 03:55:14 .:uwharrie:.	it could also install a keylogger to collect your passwords or read them out of memory after they've been unencrypted
Nov 17 03:55:59 .:kfrench:.	uwharrie: Maybe run ssh-agent as a different user?
Nov 17 03:56:06 .:sumthing1980:.	hello how can cli programs detect change in window size, Id like to detect it as well
Nov 17 03:56:27 .:bdn:.	Hmm alright. There's no particular app I'm worried about, but I'm weary of using programs with 3rd-party plugins like NPM and Ruby as I worry some malicious module will just grab my key and upload it somewhere
Nov 17 03:57:02 .:uwharrie:.	sumthing1980: add an signal handler for SIGWINCH
Nov 17 03:57:24 .:bdn:.	kfrench: the key is password-protected
Nov 17 03:57:26 .:sumthing1980:.	Ill look into it
Nov 17 03:59:12 .:bdn:.	my ideal linux setup would have a "home" area with only 100% trusted apps, and a container completely sandboxed from the base system where I install npm, third party stuff. I could do this all through Docker/Podman, but I know it's not a perfect sandbox. Anyone have thoughts on this?
Nov 17 03:59:36 .:NorrinRadd:.	why is paste.debian.net not working?
Nov 17 03:59:42 .:kfrench:.	bdn: I'd say start with that and fix any remaining issues once you have it all working.
Nov 17 04:00:09 .:uwharrie:.	bdn: containers aren't intended to be a security mechanism. sounds like you want something more like qubes
Nov 17 04:01:07 .:bdn:.	I'm very interested in qubes, but unsure if it will run on my framework machine
Nov 17 04:01:18 .:uwharrie:.	but I'd focus more on finding packages that don't pull directly from npm/pypi/gems/etc
Nov 17 04:01:22 .:rascul:.	use different users
Nov 17 04:01:23 .:bdn:.	I'll take another look into it though. thanks for the reccomendation uwharrie
Nov 17 04:02:03 .:bdn:.	uwharrie: what do you mean by "packages that don't pull directly from [...]"? Like installing things through DNF/APT instead?
Nov 17 04:02:16 .:uwharrie:.	yes
Nov 17 04:03:13 .:bdn:.	appreciate the ideas everyone
Nov 17 04:03:45 .:bdn:.	rascul: not a bad idea. are users, by default, unable to access other users' files?
Nov 17 04:03:48 .:kfrench:.	bdn: Maybe use fapolicyd to watch for and block access to your ssh keys
Nov 17 04:04:34 .:bdn:.	kfrench: will look into fapolicyd, thanks
Nov 17 04:05:33 .:rascul:.	bdn some distros are setup in such a fashion, if not then it's a simple chmod
Nov 17 04:11:40 .:sumthing1980:.	uwharrie: I guess you maybe are not familiar with php ? I am able to detect SIGWINCH with pcntl_signal(SIGWINCH, 	"signal_handlerfunction");
Nov 17 04:12:28 .:sumthing1980:.	second parameter to that function becomes an array it has [signo=28, errno=0, code=128] as contents, but no info on window dimensions
Nov 17 04:12:30 .:uwharrie:.	not with using PHP for anything other than web stuff
Nov 17 04:12:34 .:arch-nemesis:.	Yeah bdn: I second qubes for the applicatoin containerization. There's a couple of others that are in the same vein, like Tails and Whonix
Nov 17 04:12:43 .:sumthing1980:.	ok
Nov 17 04:13:14 .:uwharrie:.	the signal triggers to let you know things have changed. it's up to you to query what that change is
Nov 17 04:13:34 .:arch-nemesis:.	I think that was the part of the dream of application sandboxes like snapcraft, but at least for me those things only work about 90%
Nov 17 04:13:47 .:sumthing1980:.	okay but it is a terminal window, who would query what I have no idea?
Nov 17 04:14:46 .:arch-nemesis:.	bdn: by default, the security model is discressionary, meaning users can share files and folders with other users using chmod, etc.
Nov 17 04:15:26 .:uwharrie:.	shell'ing out to `stty` can get it for you if you don't have a library that can make the TIOCGWINSZ ioctl()
Nov 17 04:15:32 .:arch-nemesis:.	So other users probably can't look at your home directory...but you could change that. And for that matter, any application you run could change that as well.
Nov 17 04:15:52 .:sumthing1980:.	ioctl says linux manual page
Nov 17 04:16:06 .:sumthing1980:.	okay is there any shell command for getting win dimensions?

Nov 17 04:19:33 .:sumthing1980:.	that is also very cool
Nov 17 04:19:39 .:sumthing1980:.	so many interesting things

Nov 17 04:54:59 .:BlkIvy:.	i should totally use discordrc

Nov 17 05:10:04 .:Sauvin:.	Don't ewe gist love pee pal who keep gitting words mixed up, like "duel" and "dual"; "to", "too", "two"; "principal", "principal"; "capital", "capitol" and the like - and use words whose meanings they don't no, like the difference tween "imply" and "infer"? Makes stuff hard too reed.

Nov 17 05:11:03 .:lockywolf:.	How does Ubuntu LTS behave on a server?
Nov 17 05:11:18 .:Sauvin:.	lockywolf, same as any other distro would.
Nov 17 05:11:30 .:Khaytsus:.	How would you think it behaves besides...  like a normal linux system?
Nov 17 05:11:44 .:lockywolf:.	well, in my experience rolling-releases tend to be less convenient
Nov 17 05:12:07 .:Khaytsus:.	Ubuntu isn't a rolling release?
Nov 17 05:12:12 .:Sauvin:.	You don't want a rolling release on a server that serves anybody but yourself.
Nov 17 05:12:16 .:Sauvin:.	No.
Nov 17 05:13:05 .:Sauvin:.	Of all the Debian and/or derivatives I know anything about, only Debian testing or Debian unstable would be "rolling release".
Nov 17 05:13:16 .:lockywolf:.	exactly, therefore "like any distro" is not entirely accurate
Nov 17 05:13:33 .:Khaytsus:.	What are actually rolling releases..  Arch?  Fedora rawhide?  "rolling release" is rather poorly defined
Nov 17 05:13:49 .:Khaytsus:.	lockywolf: garbage question garbage answer
Nov 17 05:13:50 .:Sauvin:.	Ubuntu would act like Ubuntu on a server, and Gentoo would behave like Gentoo, shortbus.
Nov 17 05:13:50 .:lockywolf:.	arch, gentoo,
Nov 17 05:14:14 .:lockywolf:.	🤦‍♂️
Nov 17 05:14:18 .:iflema:.	a bit of force
Nov 17 05:14:38 .:Khaytsus:.	More like "a bit of farce"
Nov 17 05:15:18 .:lockywolf:.	Has anyone actually used Ubuntu on a server, as well as some other distro to compare with, and has a definite opinion on which one is better?
Nov 17 05:15:30 .:Sauvin:.	Khaytsus, Ubuntu and suchlike have regular major releases. In the case of the LTS, I think it's like every two years. In those two years, the only things I can think of that actually change versions are browsers (they're a moving target). Everything stays at a given revision level until the next major release, and receives only security updates, patches and such.
Nov 17 05:16:00 .:Khaytsus:.	Sauvin: Yes, not dislike CentOS/RHEL.  Backports, safe updates, no major changes.
Nov 17 05:16:07 .:Sauvin:.	lockywolf, I think the general feeling is that Debian would be more stable than Ubuntu, and therefore more suitable.
Nov 17 05:16:10 .:Khaytsus:.	I still don't grok why he's talking about rolling releases yet asking about Ubuntu.
Nov 17 05:16:49 .:Sauvin:.	He's just being curious. Maybe he's not acutely aware of the differences between "rolling" and "not", or of between "server" or "desktop".
Nov 17 05:17:49 .:sumthing1980:.	whaaaat I discovered a program xte from xautomation, you write xte 'mousemove x y' and it moves the mouse !\
Nov 17 05:17:50 .:Khaytsus:.	Seems like a strange way to ask "Would UButntu LTS make a good server"
Nov 17 05:17:59 .:Khaytsus:.	sumthing1980: It does.
Nov 17 05:18:23 .:Khaytsus:.	sumthing1980: https://paste.centos.org/view/104e09a6
Nov 17 05:18:45 .:Khaytsus:.	Well, I use xdotool here actually
Nov 17 05:19:13 .:Khaytsus:.	Left/right on my mouse wheel moves between monitors
Nov 17 05:19:37 .:sumthing1980:.	oh thats lazy
Nov 17 05:20:01 .:Khaytsus:.	Lazy man does the job efficiently.
Nov 17 05:20:15 .:sumthing1980:.	:)
Nov 17 05:20:26 .:sumthing1980:.	so you dont use mouse wheel for anything else?
Nov 17 05:20:26 .:Khaytsus:.	https://paste.centos.org/view/1635cbf2  Also this...  move mouse to window and activate it.
Nov 17 05:20:38 .:Khaytsus:.	Mouse wheel up/down/in does normal things
Nov 17 05:21:11 .:Khaytsus:.	I have the otherwise useless forward and back buttons using the script above to move to my editor for one, flip through CHrome windows for the other.
Nov 17 05:22:06 .:sumthing1980:.	I have been thinking there should be a device for your left hand for more controls to browse and such
Nov 17 05:22:08 .:Khaytsus:.	I always have like 3 Chrome windows open, bounce between them with a mouse button click is handy
Nov 17 05:22:09 .:sumthing1980:.	I get your point
Nov 17 05:22:19 .:sumthing1980:.	if there was a wheel for the left hand for example
Nov 17 05:22:20 .:Khaytsus:.	Sure you could have a macro pad
Nov 17 05:22:33 .:sumthing1980:.	for scrolling back and forth in browser for example
Nov 17 05:22:34 .:Khaytsus:.	I prefer to keep my hand on the keyboard, but
Nov 17 05:22:52 .:sumthing1980:.	macro pad... takes nodes
Nov 17 05:22:54 .:sumthing1980:.	notes
Nov 17 05:23:21 .:Khaytsus:.	I've been piddling with making a cheap USB number pad a macro pad..  Half the price ;)
Nov 17 05:23:41 .:sumthing1980:.	You know what idea I had, you know of novation live devices ?
Nov 17 05:23:44 .:sumthing1980:.	for music
Nov 17 05:23:50 .:sumthing1980:.	in fruity loops for example
Nov 17 05:24:04 .:Khaytsus:.	Macro pads are frequently used to control music, sound effects, cameras, etc.
Nov 17 05:24:06 .:erizo74:.	.
Nov 17 05:24:12 .:sumthing1980:.	here https://novationmusic.com/en/launch/launchpad-mini
Nov 17 05:24:34 .:sumthing1980:.	you could buy some numpad usb keyboard
Nov 17 05:24:38 .:sumthing1980:.	and reprogram the keys
Nov 17 05:24:40 .:sumthing1980:.	and play music
Nov 17 05:24:52 .:sumthing1980:.	dope
Nov 17 05:25:40 .:Khaytsus:.	Yep, xmodmap + xbindkeys
Nov 17 05:29:08 .:Khaytsus:.	erizo74: Can you please stop bopping in and out?
Nov 17 05:29:22 .:Khaytsus:.	If you're testing something, do it outside of channels
Nov 17 05:29:34 .:erizo74:.	sorry
Nov 17 05:35:43 .:sumthing1980:.	so I am detecting mouse movement in php, I activate it with  echo "\e[?1003h\e[?1015h\e[?1006h"
Nov 17 05:36:14 .:sumthing1980:.	Im supposed to deactivate with echo "\e[?1000l"; or echo "\e[?1000;1006;1015l"; but it shows gibberish on screen after it shuts down
Nov 17 05:36:28 .:sumthing1980:.	when I move the mouse.
Nov 17 05:39:35 .:nero:.	sumthing1980: is that for xterm?
Nov 17 05:39:46 .:sumthing1980:.	echoed from php
Nov 17 05:39:49 .:sumthing1980:.	in cli, terminal
Nov 17 05:40:02 .:nero:.	its a terminal control sequence
Nov 17 05:40:11 .:nero:.	its interpreted and done by the terminal emulator
Nov 17 05:40:18 .:sumthing1980:.	yea
Nov 17 05:40:18 .:nero:.	or the terminal, if you have a real one
Nov 17 05:40:36 .:sumthing1980:.	I should find the instructions for that
Nov 17 05:40:42 .:nero:.	for ncurses
Nov 17 05:41:42 .:nero:.	where do you have these sequences from?
Nov 17 05:41:43 .:sumthing1980:.	I am writing a cli program with some mouse functionality
Nov 17 05:41:54 .:sumthing1980:.	KB and mouse input
Nov 17 05:41:57 .:sumthing1980:.	wait
Nov 17 05:42:53 .:nero:.	the terminal emulator is interpreting these sequences
Nov 17 05:43:06 .:nero:.	if you get gibberish, your terminal does not understand them, probably
Nov 17 05:43:16 .:cartdrige:.	what program you writing?
Nov 17 05:43:17 .:sumthing1980:.	no I mean after activated I read them in php
Nov 17 05:43:28 .:sumthing1980:.	xy coords and mouse action and kb input
Nov 17 05:43:40 .:sumthing1980:.	but after closing it gobbles up my screen
Nov 17 05:43:45 .:nero:.	yeah
Nov 17 05:43:46 .:sumthing1980:.	Im supposed to turn them off
Nov 17 05:43:52 .:nero:.	because these sequences are wrong
Nov 17 05:44:17 .:sumthing1980:.	are these ansi by any chance ?
Nov 17 05:44:24 .:nero:.	no
Nov 17 05:44:27 .:nero:.	they are extensions
Nov 17 05:44:30 .:Khaytsus:.	You're using PHP... on......... purpose?
Nov 17 05:44:35 .:Khaytsus:.	Are you okay?
Nov 17 05:44:38 .:sumthing1980:.	yeah
Nov 17 05:44:46 .:sumthing1980:.	eheh
Nov 17 05:44:51 .:nero:.	sumthing1980: which sequences work and which dont depends on your terminal emulator
Nov 17 05:45:08 .:nero:.	so if you dont know which terminal emulator you use, we cant even help you except for pointing to ncurses
Nov 17 05:45:16 .:nero:.	which has a database of many possible terminals
Nov 17 05:45:17 .:sumthing1980:.	and I detect SIGWINCH that detects new xy size of terminal
Nov 17 05:45:38 .:sumthing1980:.	what was the question again ?
Nov 17 05:45:59 .:Khaytsus:.	Blink twice if you're under duress sumthing1980
Nov 17 05:46:01 .:nero:.	which is you terminal and where did you read about these sequences
Nov 17 05:46:16 .:cartdrige:.	a mouse in the terminal is ok, don't forget to put a cheese: :]
Nov 17 05:46:37 .:rascul:.	<blink>twice</blink>
Nov 17 05:46:46 .:sumthing1980:.	trying to find the page i got it from
Nov 17 05:46:47 .:cartdrige:.	and a: cat... mouse > stomac
Nov 17 05:46:47 .:sumthing1980:.	:)
Nov 17 05:46:57 .:Khaytsus:.	<marquee>no</marquee>
Nov 17 05:47:18 .:Khaytsus:.	Hahahaha if you search for marquee on google...  the results scrolls at the top.  Well played.
Nov 17 05:47:19 .:rascul:.	<blink><marquee>party time!</marquee></blink>
Nov 17 05:47:31 .:sumthing1980:.	here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5966903/how-to-get-mousemove-and-mouseclick-in-bash
Nov 17 05:47:59 .:sumthing1980:.	wat it doesnt scroll anything for me
Nov 17 05:48:09 .:nero:.	sumthing1980: the answer is for xterm
Nov 17 05:48:12 .:nero:.	are you using xterm?
Nov 17 05:48:24 .:sumthing1980:.	terminator
Nov 17 05:48:34 .:sumthing1980:.	is my current thing
Nov 17 05:48:38 .:nero:.	so the answer from stackoverflow is invalid for you
Nov 17 05:49:12 .:sumthing1980:.	well... It does detect mouse movement and clicks
Nov 17 05:49:29 .:sumthing1980:.	I just need to find how to turn it off
Nov 17 05:50:05 .:rascul:.	other terminal emulators implement xterm stuff
Nov 17 05:50:24 .:nero:.	to varying success
Nov 17 05:51:10 .:rascul:.	usually decent success though
Nov 17 05:51:34 .:nero:.	lol
Nov 17 05:51:40 .:rascul:.	i would be surprised if the mouse stuff wasn't available in any popular terminal emulator that isn't from suckless
Nov 17 05:51:46 .:nero:.	yeah, as long as you dont try to use the DEC alternate character sets
Nov 17 05:52:03 .:nero:.	it seems ncurses doesnt even have the mouse stuff in its database
Nov 17 05:53:26 .:sumthing1980:.	okay in xterm it stops showing the coords
Nov 17 05:53:32 .:sumthing1980:.	I could switch
Nov 17 05:53:42 .:sumthing1980:.	is xterm more popular
Nov 17 05:53:54 .:nero:.	no, but xterm emulates xterm best
Nov 17 05:54:04 .:sumthing1980:.	brilliant
Nov 17 05:54:05 .:rascul:.	better than all the rest
Nov 17 05:54:15 .:pnbeast:.	I have measured it.  xterm is objectively better.
Nov 17 05:54:18 .:sumthing1980:.	tina turner - simply the best
Nov 17 05:54:26 .:rascul:.	pnbeast better than what?
Nov 17 05:54:28 .:nero:.	terminator seems to be a gnome-terminal thing
Nov 17 05:54:39 .:nero:.	of course gnome people dont write docs on such subtleties
Nov 17 05:54:41 .:pnbeast:.	Whatever you pick.
Nov 17 05:55:00 .:rascul:.	i pick zucchini
Nov 17 05:55:07 .:pnbeast:.	xterm is better.
Nov 17 05:55:17 .:nero:.	xterm is the best xterm emulator.
Nov 17 05:55:19 .:sumthing1980:.	whered do you change font size on xterm
Nov 17 05:55:31 .:nero:.	and if your TERM is xterm, you better run the real xterm
Nov 17 05:55:49 .:nero:.	i think it was control and right mouse clock
Nov 17 05:55:51 .:nero:.	*click
Nov 17 05:56:01 .:rascul:.	~/.Xresouces
Nov 17 05:57:02 .:sumthing1980:.	it has "unreadable" as font size option
Nov 17 05:57:11 .:nero:.	sumthing1980: it makes the text unreadable
Nov 17 05:57:21 .:rascul:.	good option
Nov 17 05:57:34 .:rascul:.	i recommend it
Nov 17 05:57:43 .:sumthing1980:.	only for real pros
Nov 17 05:57:45 .:nero:.	Xresources used to be some kind of standard for x configs
Nov 17 05:58:01 .:nero:.	but now every new program cooks their own thing
Nov 17 05:58:39 .:keir:.	it's healthier to cook your own configs
Nov 17 05:58:44 .:keir:.	at least you know what's in it
Nov 17 05:58:55 .:keir:.	and you can use organic keys and values
Nov 17 05:59:01 .:nero:.	i wish more programs would respect xresources
Nov 17 06:02:09 .:nero:.	i also wish more shells who claim to be POSIX compatible would actually implement it
Nov 17 06:04:24 .:nero:.	posix specifies that '!' in PS1 is expanded, and regular '$' parameter expansion is to be done
Nov 17 06:05:05 .:nero:.	The FreeBSD shell is legendary in that aspect because it claims to be posix compatible but supports neither
Nov 17 06:05:19 .:nero:.	FreeBSD default shell, some early almquist shell
Nov 17 06:11:38 .:ayecee:.	artisan configs have more warmth
Nov 17 06:13:50 .:rascul:.	sometimes i don't have the time to cook a config and i stop at McConfig
Nov 17 06:16:49 .:ayecee:.	you can tell they're artisan by the unique imperfections that make each one different
Nov 17 06:25:56 .:small:.	why does recvmsg return invalid argument
Nov 17 06:25:59 .:small:.	im doing this:    server [ socket AF_UNIX, bind AF_UNIX - NAME, recvmsg ]  client [ socket AF_UNIX, connect NAME, sendmsg ]
Nov 17 06:26:52 .:ayecee:.	invalid argument to recvmsg
Nov 17 06:27:28 .:ayecee:.	so, what were the arguments to recvmsg
Nov 17 06:28:42 .:small:.	https://gist.github.com/mgood7123/63995f8dd4df52c75278b820a16ecc0f
Nov 17 06:32:22 .:ayecee:.	does recvmsg normally work on SOCK_STREAM sockets?
Nov 17 06:32:35 .:nero:.	yes
Nov 17 06:33:52 .:ayecee:.	i see
Nov 17 06:37:30 .:sumthing1980:.	there is no way of doing file transfers from inside a ssh shell right ?
Nov 17 06:38:25 .:nero:.	there used to be xmodem but it went out of fashion before ssh came to be
Nov 17 06:38:28 .:sumthing1980:.	I mean like a browser you click somethings and a file starts transfering
Nov 17 06:38:37 .:sumthing1980:.	and z modem
Nov 17 06:38:43 .:sumthing1980:.	from bbs times right
Nov 17 06:42:08 .:ayecee:.	nero: don't know if it'd be relevant, but msg.msg_flags does not seem to be initialized.
Nov 17 06:42:33 .:ayecee:.	oh, that's set by the function.
Nov 17 06:44:47 .:ayecee:.	*shrug* dunno what part is invalid.
Nov 17 08:12:33 .:rascul:.	oranges are orange
Nov 17 08:13:10 .:pnbeast:.	What about blood oranges?

Nov 17 08:15:03 .:rascul:.	where can i get those glasses?
Nov 17 08:15:04 .:pnbeast:.	I have that synethesia thing.  And poor spelling, probably...
Nov 17 08:15:10 .:Czernobog:.	pnbeast they will be confused af

Nov 17 08:15:41 .:pnbeast:.	Czernobog, sounds like less work for me.
Nov 17 08:15:54 .:Sauvin:.	Czernobog, confuse air force?
Nov 17 08:16:10 .:Czernobog:.	as f*ck
Nov 17 08:16:21 .:Sauvin:.	In that case, omit "af" from your messages here.
Nov 17 08:24:56 .:lockywolf:.	confusing air force might be classified as a counter-intelligence

Nov 17 08:26:52 .:lockywolf:.	does NATO have some fancy acronym for counterintelligence ?

Nov 17 08:27:24 .:ssm_:.	not sure if off topic, but is there a way to undervolt the cpu or gpu on the steam deck (either in linux or efi/bios)

Nov 17 08:28:02 .:execrate:.	no it doesnt
Nov 17 08:28:09 .:nero:.	because this is what linux executes per default if init= is not specified in the command line

Nov 17 08:28:22 .:nero:.	or init=/bin/bash on the kernel command line
Nov 17 08:28:31 .:execrate:.	okkk i will do this
Nov 17 08:28:34 .:execrate:.	i try
Nov 17 08:28:56 .:lockywolf:.	if you want to run kernel+bash only, that might not be a trivial task to achieve

Nov 17 08:30:01 .:lolok:.	you sure you dont just want runlevel 3 or multi-user target instead?
Nov 17 08:30:16 .:lockywolf:.	and find out how to link bash statically
Nov 17 08:30:35 .:lockywolf:.	you are probably better off with uclibc than glibc
Nov 17 08:32:46 .:execrate:.	statically mean without dependance ?

Nov 17 08:34:32 .:Czernobog:.	what is the software center in gnome called?
Nov 17 08:34:51 .:Czernobog:.	I want to launch it using cli since it's not working when i click the icon
Nov 17 08:34:56 .:lolok:.	execrate if youre on a linux distro now, type `sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target` assuming you have systemd, it will drop you to a shell with no gui but the full system is still usable
Nov 17 08:35:48 .:execrate:.	mutter ?
Nov 17 08:36:31 .:lolok:.	 /usr/bin/gnome-software
Nov 17 08:36:46 .:execrate:.	lolok thx
Nov 17 08:37:25 .:Czernobog:.	it says command not found. hmm Will have to install it i guess
Nov 17 08:37:42 .:execrate:.	nero libraries are not in the same filesystem, it is the problem, i think
Nov 17 08:38:58 .:Czernobog:.	okay, the gnome-software is a different software manager compared to the one which is already installed
Nov 17 08:39:07 .:Czernobog:.	pre-installed
Nov 17 08:43:42 .:Czernobog:.	it's a snap package called snap-store
Nov 17 08:43:46 .:Czernobog:.	the heck
Nov 17 08:44:31 .:TurkeyLlama:.	how do I add files to a debian live boot USB stick?
Nov 17 08:49:40 .:lolok:.	Czernobog oh ubuntu good luck lol
Nov 17 08:50:09 .:lolok:.	i used to recommend ubuntu
Nov 17 08:50:17 .:eagle:.	but then you grew up
Nov 17 08:51:13 .:lolok:.	you know how you say 'its not you its me' but it was definatly them? yea, ubuntu...
Nov 17 08:51:39 .:eagle:.	"STABILITY!"
Nov 17 08:52:02 .:tusko:.	cp
Nov 17 08:55:30 .:Czernobog:.	lolok it's for work. all employees use ubuntu 20.04
Nov 17 08:58:21 .:lolok:.	Czernobog thats fair lol, but yea snaps are a dumpster fire, afaik you can still get most things using apt [or gnome-software maybe?] from the normal repo and i would advise this wherever possible
Nov 17 08:58:50 .:eagle:.	snaps arent that bad
Nov 17 08:58:53 .:eagle:.	just get used to snap service etc
Nov 17 08:59:11 .:eagle:.	tho in the end I dont like snaps
Nov 17 08:59:34 .:eagle:.	native package managers > *
Nov 17 09:00:29 .:Czernobog:.	lolok yeah I know but not everyone knows how to use aptitude so they tend to stick to the gui
Nov 17 09:01:04 .:eagle:.	lol what sort of company puts ubuntu in front of people who are afraid to `sudo apt update` ?
Nov 17 09:01:19 .:eagle:.	wait...
Nov 17 09:01:20 .:eagle:.	its ubuntu
Nov 17 09:01:22 .:lolok:.	i dont wanna, and i especially dislike the way they have shoveled it onto users, and the snap store being a closed ecosystem
Nov 17 09:03:26 .:Czernobog:.	I didn't say people are afraid of using it I said people don't know and are more familiar with the store
Nov 17 09:03:42 .:eagle:.	sounds like fear
Nov 17 09:04:16 .:Czernobog:.	they should know that aptitude exists first
Nov 17 09:05:00 .:Czernobog:.	then they can start fearing about snap
Nov 17 09:09:20 .:lolok:.	if i was gonna force my employees to use a specific distro im not sure if ubuntu or gentoo would be more sadistic
Nov 17 09:12:51 .:akibageek:.	Hey all. Is there a word for the fear of being called a noob in the linux community? I installed Arch Linux instead of Ubuntu for my first distro, and I'm crying because everything is so hard to setup. I think I'm slowly figuring everything out, but feel I cannot keep doing this.
Nov 17 09:13:43 .:akibageek:.	I had to choose it out of peer pressure and fear... I am surrounded by geeks who would laugh at me for using anything beginner friendly
Nov 17 09:15:52 .:Simbukka:.	let them laugh, it's their problem
Nov 17 09:16:28 .:Simbukka:.	everyone has been novice at first
Nov 17 09:22:19 .:EdFletcher:.	making decisions out of pressure and fear is almost guaranteed to produce a suboptimal choice
Nov 17 09:22:39 .:EdFletcher:.	and clearly that's what has happened here. best to cut your losses now and move onto a friendlier distro.
Nov 17 09:23:39 .:lolok:.	aw he left, just answered his question in #archlinux, dumb as it was lol
Nov 17 09:24:40 .:jb1277976:.	if you send a message to a list you arne't subcriibed to is it normal not to get a reply in your inbox? just wondering cuase they replied to me but its not in my inbox or all mail
Nov 17 09:25:22 .:lolok:.	spam filter maybe?
Nov 17 09:26:03 .:budlight:.	arch takes a little getting use too
Nov 17 09:28:28 .:lolok:.	arch is for people who can already navigate a system comfortably using only a terminal, i see people recommend it to complete noobs so they will learn, this is terrible like taking someone who cant add and expecting them to learn calculus
Nov 17 09:29:08 .:budlight:.	true
Nov 17 09:29:33 .:jb1277976:.	lolok: it was in my spam  :P  Thanks so obvious
Nov 17 09:29:41 .:lolok:.	:p np
Nov 17 09:29:41 .:budlight:.	i have'nt use arch in a long time
Nov 17 09:30:32 .:Simbukka:.	lolok: exactly what I was thinking. not so great idea; like throwing someone who can't swim, to a lake
Nov 17 09:31:20 .:lolok:.	i love arch, but i didnt start using it until 5-10 years after i started using linux, and my 1st manual install still took me 3 tries to get it right
Nov 17 09:33:09 .:budlight:.	do you use a gui or cmd
Nov 17 09:34:30 .:lolok:.	i boot to multi-user.target, so no gui, but i do have a de and i use it regularly
Nov 17 09:34:49 .:budlight:.	cool
Nov 17 09:38:26 .:lolok:.	tmux is the best desktop tho lol
Nov 17 09:39:53 .:jb1277976:.	lolok: you are right. the few times i used tmux i know it has numbers at the bottom and you can switch between them.  screen you got to do screen -list etc .. or something with " never really got into tmux for some reason
Nov 17 09:40:54 .:budlight:.	me iam kde fan
Nov 17 09:41:15 .:jb1277976:.	never got into kde also. its either dwm or i3
Nov 17 09:41:41 .:EdFletcher:.	different tools for different problems. can't run gimp in tmux or screen. both are great for running irssi forever on a cloud machine.
Nov 17 09:41:55 .:lolok:.	there is some way to get a status bar in screen, but tmux is faster and smaller ram usage, plus i got the 8 or 9 keybinds i use regularly in muscle memory already lol thats the best part
Nov 17 09:42:58 .:jb1277976:.	EdFletcher: i only use weechat on a vps that i ssh into. i run neomutt in a terminal when i want mail. other then that im in X
Nov 17 09:43:13 .:EdFletcher:.	jb1277976: there ya go
Nov 17 09:43:44 .:EdFletcher:.	but with a simple addition of tmux or screen you could avoid reconnecting every time you login
Nov 17 09:43:50 .:lolok:.	i play vidyagames, and tho nethack is fun and all, i prefer something that isnt turn based
Nov 17 09:44:19 .:EdFletcher:.	videogames run in windows
Nov 17 09:45:10 .:budlight:.	they also run on linux though wine quite well
Nov 17 09:45:18 .:EdFletcher:.	speaking of, going to give them a shout even though it's off-topic because they're indie and i want them to succeed: "Book of Travels" is amazing
Nov 17 09:45:59 .:EdFletcher:.	budlight: lol sure, but that's a windows emulation layer 😆 still windows! don't get me wrong, i love games and play a ton of them. but i prefer to play them in the environment the developers intended. they're a stress relief, i have no time for them to be stressors.
Nov 17 09:46:38 .:lolok:.	ok i was with you on the different tools thing, but there are also bad tools and good tools, windows is a great tool to stab yourself in the gut to experience the pain of slowly dieing of sepsis
Nov 17 09:46:52 .:EdFletcher:.	LMAO no hyperbole there
Nov 17 09:47:31 .:lockywolf:.	I think playing emulated games is twice more fun.
Nov 17 09:47:35 .:EdFletcher:.	and if your zealotry for one tool makes you myopic to the others available, that's a "you" problem
Nov 17 09:47:38 .:xx:.	there was an update to grub on debian, but the files in the ESP partition have an unchanged timestamp. Is there something I'm expected to do manually after upgrading grub?
Nov 17 09:47:53 .:xx:.	I know how to do it, am just surprised that it's not part of `apt upgrade`
Nov 17 09:47:54 .:EdFletcher:.	lockywolf: lol hows that, adds an extra layer of challenge? 😉
Nov 17 09:48:37 .:lockywolf:.	lolok: you are overstating it
Nov 17 09:48:48 .:budlight:.	better then dual boot
Nov 17 09:48:49 .:EdFletcher:.	noooo, not hyperbolic at all
Nov 17 09:48:50 .:lockywolf:.	Windows is a fine OS for simple tasks
Nov 17 09:49:11 .:lockywolf:.	EdFletcher: yeah, additional layer of enjoyment
Nov 17 09:49:23 .:lolok:.	no its not, it reboots in the middle of your work, i want a simple task to be done in 5 min not wait 2 hours for an update
Nov 17 09:49:51 .:lockywolf:.	hm... never happened to me
Nov 17 09:50:00 .:EdFletcher:.	"tell me you haven't actually used windows in years without telling me you haven't actually used windows in years" 😆
Nov 17 09:50:20 .:EdFletcher:.	but not tool-myopic, nope 🤦
Nov 17 09:50:20 .:lockywolf:.	well, I haven't used windows since WinXP
Nov 17 09:50:35 .:EdFletcher:.	my goodness, y'all don't even have a leg to discuss on
Nov 17 09:50:38 .:lockywolf:.	but XP didn't do that
Nov 17 09:50:42 .:lolok:.	i had an update fail to install in windows, and then windows tried to undo the update wihtout giving me any option and then failed at that too, ive never had that happen on linux
Nov 17 09:51:05 .:EdFletcher:.	yes and your one data point makes for broad conclusions too right
Nov 17 09:51:13 .:EdFletcher:.	come on folks, at least try here
Nov 17 09:51:31 .:lockywolf:.	yeah, because if an update fails on Linux, you are screwed
Nov 17 09:51:47 .:lolok:.	winxp was nice, win7 was good too, after that users lost what little control they had
Nov 17 09:51:52 .:lockywolf:.	linux has no update rollback function
Nov 17 09:52:04 .:eagle:.	win7... the last great one
Nov 17 09:52:12 .:eagle:.	We had a good few years with windows 10 tho...
Nov 17 09:52:28 .:lockywolf:.	for some reason the windows 10 in my VM got updated to Windows10-2022, not Windows 11
Nov 17 09:52:30 .:eagle:.	that wasnt half bad... but then boom... ads in start menu + windows 11 tries to become more mac like
Nov 17 09:52:31 .:lolok:.	i lost power twice during an upgrad on linux, arch and debian, both continued where they left off when i reastrted after unlocking the db
Nov 17 09:53:12 .:lockywolf:.	ah, mac...
Nov 17 09:53:25 .:lockywolf:.	Hey, I am Mac! And I am a PC!
Nov 17 09:54:41 .:lolok:.	also try zfs or lvm of you want rollback in linux, also idk if you ever tried to rollback in windows, but lmao just try it one day

Nov 17 10:01:48 .:budlight:.	what wifi card is in it
Nov 17 10:01:57 .:TurkyLma-:.	no one can help on IRC and there are no forums with a solution
Nov 17 10:02:00 .:lolok:.	lets try this a different way, remember when you downloaded debian? give a link to the file you got
Nov 17 10:02:12 .:TurkyLma-:.	BCM4312
Nov 17 10:02:28 .:TurkyLma-:.	well lemme get the iso name for you
Nov 17 10:02:44 .:TurkyLma-:.	debian-live-11.5.0-i386-lxqt.iso
Nov 17 10:02:49 .:TurkyLma-:.	and it does not work
Nov 17 10:02:55 .:xx:.	TurkyLma-: that's because that's the wrong iso
Nov 17 10:02:55 .:TurkyLma-:.	it will install without wifi support
Nov 17 10:03:04 .:xx:.	use the right iso and it will work
Nov 17 10:03:05 .:TurkyLma-:.	it is?
Nov 17 10:03:08 .:lolok:.	yea, wrong iso lol, you need the nonfree one for wifi

Nov 17 10:05:31 .:TurkyLma-:.	keeps telling me it's the wrong password or something
Nov 17 10:05:53 .:xx:.	sounds like you did something wrong during the installation, or the installer messed up because you had broken internet
Nov 17 10:06:04 .:lolok:.	https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/11.5.0-live+nonfree/i386/iso-hybrid/debian-live-11.5.0-i386-lxqt+nonfree.iso

Nov 17 10:26:04 .:TurkyLma-:.	it asked for the .FW files and I plug that USB in
Nov 17 10:26:25 .:TurkyLma-:.	and it doesn't copy them until I removd the installation USB drive
Nov 17 10:26:29 .:TurkyLma-:.	ah well
Nov 17 10:26:48 .:TurkyLma-:.	so besides slackware what others support i386?
Nov 17 10:27:00 .:tusko:.	In Tehran, IR it is 11.9 C with a low of 8.9 and high of 12.1 C, humidity is 58%, winds of 4.12 m/s from the SSW with broken clouds.
Nov 17 10:28:39 .:lockywolf:.	TurkyLma-: Slackware does not support i386
Nov 17 10:28:47 .:TurkyLma-:.	oh :/
Nov 17 10:28:55 .:TurkyLma-:.	what does lockywolf?
Nov 17 10:29:03 .:TurkyLma-:.	someone said it does
Nov 17 10:29:06 .:TurkyLma-:.	I look
Nov 17 10:29:07 .:lockywolf:.	well, pretty much only older distros
Nov 17 10:29:30 .:lockywolf:.	I think, Slackware-15 is i586
Nov 17 10:29:38 .:EdFletcher:.	lockywolf: slackware 15 x86 (32-bit) begs to differ http://www.slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=i386
Nov 17 10:29:45 .:EdFletcher:.	released "Thu Nov 17 01:49:28 UTC 2022"
Nov 17 10:29:57 .:lockywolf:.	nah, i386 in the URL is not indicative
Nov 17 10:30:07 .:lockywolf:.	that i386 just means "not x86_64"
Nov 17 10:30:34 .:EdFletcher:.	ohhhh i keep missing TurkyLma- specifically needs the i386 arch no "not x86_64"
Nov 17 10:30:43 .:EdFletcher:.	*not "not
Nov 17 10:30:46 .:EdFletcher:.	that's a toughie

Nov 17 10:32:18 .:binaryhermit:.	that came out right after the first gen of netbooks that had a... 900MHz? Pentium M

Nov 17 10:32:54 .:lockywolf:.	but certainly not i386
Nov 17 10:33:18 .:lockywolf:.	586 is, like, Pentium 3
Nov 17 10:33:28 .:lockywolf:.	sorry, Pentium 1
Nov 17 10:33:54 .:alkisg:.	Yup, 1993 :)
Nov 17 10:34:09 .:lockywolf:.	Pentium 3, as well as Pentium M should be 686

Nov 17 10:35:50 .:TurkyLma-:.	yeah it's 32 bit

Nov 17 10:36:00 .:TurkyLma-:.	the i386 debian package runs on it
Nov 17 10:36:26 .:TurkyLma-:.	I just cannot get the wifi to work on it unless i pull the installation USB drive out :/
Nov 17 10:36:27 .:lockywolf:.	I think, pretty much everything will run on it, including Windows 7
Nov 17 10:36:30 .:TurkyLma-:.	and that kills it
Nov 17 10:36:45 .:TurkyLma-:.	so slackware it is! :)
Nov 17 10:36:51 .:lockywolf:.	TurkyLma-: buy something better :D
Nov 17 10:37:11 .:lockywolf:.	be wary that using Slackware is not easy
Nov 17 10:37:28 .:TurkyLma-:.	I have a pile of these lockywolf the key is NOT to toss it out
Nov 17 10:37:33 .:TurkyLma-:.	they work really well
Nov 17 10:37:54 .:lockywolf:.	yeah, they die if you pull the installation drive out
Nov 17 10:37:59 .:lockywolf:.	really-really well
Nov 17 10:38:12 .:lockywolf:.	🤦‍♂️
Nov 17 10:38:56 .:lockywolf:.	anyway, I think that Dell's 7-th series laptops are the best
Nov 17 10:39:32 .:TurkyLma-:.	well if I don't install the FW files it works great lockywolf AND I have proven that it works with the wifi card but I can't finish the installation... it's some kind of bug with this box
Nov 17 10:39:37 .:TurkyLma-:.	dunno why dunt care at this point
Nov 17 10:40:18 .:lockywolf:.	then buy something better
Nov 17 10:40:31 .:lockywolf:.	as a user of a laptop from 2014, I am telling you
Nov 17 10:40:38 .:lockywolf:.	8 years is enough
Nov 17 10:41:32 .:TurkyLma-:.	nope!
Nov 17 10:44:13 .:TurkeyLlama:.	so I can't find a download for slackware i386
Nov 17 10:48:09 .:live1:.	found a _hack_ to decrease system boot time. the hack is don't shut it down _at all_. BOOM! boot times = zero.
Nov 17 10:49:15 .:lolok:.	windows already patched that bug
Nov 17 10:55:06 .:TurkeyLlama:.	welp how do I add files to a debian installation USB drive?  It's RO
Nov 17 10:56:38 .:sumthing1980:.	hello has anyone heard of a terminal program that can show vector graphics like with ansi codes ?
Nov 17 11:15:48 .:lockywolf:.	live1: you are welcome! hibernation has been invented more than 30 years ago, and kernel livepatching has also been with us for a while
Nov 17 11:17:39 .:lopid:.	no idea why it couldn't be found. it's linked from the homepage: https://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-iso/slackware-15.0-iso/
Nov 17 11:21:47 .:woland:.	is there a GUI program for gamma on xorg, besides redshiftgui ?
Nov 17 11:22:01 .:woland:.	I want something with sliders and stuff
Nov 17 11:27:41 .:lopid:.	your video card driver

Nov 17 11:24:54 .:woland:.	I dont know of any intel Gui interfaces 
Nov 17 12:02:19 .:silv3r_m00n:.	how to use parted command to list partitions of a single specific device ? for example /dev/sdg
Nov 17 12:03:08 .:xx:.	silv3r_m00n: `man parted` and search for list and look at the synopsis
Nov 17 12:03:26 .:xx:.	be careful with parted, it does things without confirmation
Nov 17 12:03:33 .:lolok:.	if you just want a list, theres no need to use parted, use `lsblk` instead
Nov 17 12:03:59 .:hexnewbie:.	lsblk shows kernel view, which may differ from real partition lists; but yeah, why parted? I've learned the hard way to avoid it
Nov 17 12:04:33 .:silv3r_m00n:.	parted -l shows all devices, i want to view just single device ...
Nov 17 12:04:39 .:silv3r_m00n:.	something like parted -l /dev/sdg
Nov 17 12:04:43 .:silv3r_m00n:.	there seems to be no such option
Nov 17 12:04:54 .:hexnewbie:.	silv3r_m00n: Then don't use parted?
Nov 17 12:05:39 .:hexnewbie:.	fdisk has such option, gdisk has (albeit it only works on GPT partition tables, but msdos ones are deprecated 😜 )
Nov 17 12:06:13 .:silv3r_m00n:.	how to display file system type with lsblk ?
Nov 17 12:06:23 .:silv3r_m00n:.	also mbr/gpt infor
Nov 17 12:06:25 .:hexnewbie:.	silv3r_m00n: lsblk -o +FSTYPE
Nov 17 12:06:25 .:xx:.	this is gonna be another XY problem
Nov 17 12:07:20 .:hexnewbie:.	silv3r_m00n: Generally, filesystem types are orthogonal to partitions even if they always go side-by-side, usually another reason to avoid parted, as its filesystem support was... a good idea that didn't age well
Nov 17 12:08:02 .:xx:.	silv3r_m00n: your parted has no -l option?
Nov 17 12:08:06 .:xx:.	it works here
Nov 17 12:08:27 .:xx:.	note that it's lowercase L not uppercase i
Nov 17 12:11:05 .:silv3r_m00n:.	i want to hide mountpoints
Nov 17 12:11:11 .:silv3r_m00n:.	 lsblk -e7 -o +FSTYPE,PARTLABEL,-MOUNTPOINTS  this doesnt work
Nov 17 12:11:16 .:silv3r_m00n:.	what should be the correct syntax ?
Nov 17 12:17:37 .:lolok:.	yea this is clearly an AB/XY problem, what are you actually trying to do? for what purpose are you using this list?
Nov 17 12:23:16 .:xx:.	`blkid` is more suited for parsing I guess

Nov 17 13:59:15 .:joo:.	is there a way to kill the firefox process when its the ubuntu snap?
Nov 17 14:01:29 .:joo:.	doesnt respond to kill or killall at all - even with -9... is this because it is a snap ? i have never experienced this, and i have been killing firefox for 20+ years
Nov 17 14:02:27 .:lopid:.	can you tell the selection with a pgrep?
Nov 17 14:02:35 .:lopid:.	or do you know the pid?
Nov 17 14:04:35 .:joo:.	i know the pid from ps aux|grep firefox
Nov 17 14:04:47 .:joo:.	but killing the pid has no effect, even with -9
Nov 17 14:07:33 .:lopid:.	15?
Nov 17 14:15:09 .:joo:.	15 ?
Nov 17 14:15:54 .:joo:.	thats the default signal right? doesnt work
Nov 17 14:16:11 .:lopid:.	yes
Nov 17 14:16:17 .:lopid:.	is it a zombie?
Nov 17 14:16:56 .:joo:.	not as far as i know
Nov 17 14:17:41 .:lopid:.	why on earth is it a snap in the first place?
Nov 17 14:18:53 .:joo:.	i should never have defiled my computer with ubuntu i guess, but hey at least starcraft2 is working :-)
Nov 17 14:20:17 .:wigums:.	you dont need ubuntu to play starcraft
Nov 17 14:22:22 .:joo:.	allright, i will get rid of this ubuntu asap
Nov 17 14:23:56 .:Qame:.	what distro would you install
Nov 17 14:26:51 .:woland:.	joo: if you wanna stay on debian based distros I recommend MX
Nov 17 14:39:10 .:richardbanger:.	idk if this is the correct channel for this quesition. but is there an xmpp client that can connect to irc?
Nov 17 14:41:46 .:djph:.	richardbanger: xmpp and IRC are different protocols (although that doesn't mean a client cannot implement both)
Nov 17 14:46:38 .:hodapp:.	fairly sure Pidgin can do both
Nov 17 14:47:20 .:richardbanger:.	im looking for a CLI client that can do both
Nov 17 14:48:05 .:hodapp:.	Finch uses the same underlying library as Pidgin and should be able
Nov 17 14:50:02 .:djph:.	richardbanger: I'm not aware of any cli clients that do both
Nov 17 14:54:36 .:Khaytsus:.	weechat has a jabber script.  No idea how good it is.
Nov 17 14:54:47 .:iomari891:.	greetings, does anyone know of a firewall distro like ipfire tha uses nftables instead of iptables?
Nov 17 14:54:50 .:Khaytsus:.	Also have no idea who uses xmpp in 2023 ;)
Nov 17 14:55:11 .:richardbanger:.	surely you mean 2019?
Nov 17 14:55:19 .:Khaytsus:.	2010 but who is counting
Nov 17 14:55:46 .:richardbanger:.	workplace cannot use irc
Nov 17 14:56:04 .:richardbanger:.	looking for the xmpp equivalent
Nov 17 14:56:21 .:djph:.	isn't that just jabber then?
Nov 17 14:56:26 .:hodapp:.	not sure what "XMPP equivalent" means
Nov 17 14:56:33 .:geirha:.	CenterICQ can do irc and xmpp, among several other protocols. Haven't tried it for years though, so not sure if it's even maintained anymore
Nov 17 14:59:54 .:geirha:.	nah, looks like it's long since abandoned
Nov 17 15:00:02 .:richardbanger:.	im just parroting what i read to sound smart
Nov 17 15:00:54 .:hodapp:.	well, try Finch
Nov 17 15:05:43 .:Blok:.	Hello. I keep getting segfaults when I compile some applications (e.g. usbutils/traceroute) using shared libraries, but not if are linked statically. I would appreciate some hints on how to troubleshoot my issue. The code segfaults before the first line of main().
Nov 17 15:06:26 .:richardbanger:.	finch seems outdated
Nov 17 15:06:58 .:hodapp:.	Blok: have you compiled with debugging symbols and run through gdb?
Nov 17 15:11:06 »»	chowbok uses xmpp in 2022
Nov 17 15:11:17 .:chowbok:.	Can't speak for 2023 yet
Nov 17 15:11:27 .:richardbanger:.	because its 2019
Nov 17 15:11:48 .:chowbok:.	If it's 2019 I'll stock up on masks and gloves
Nov 17 15:12:03 .:richardbanger:.	why?
Nov 17 15:12:17 .:chowbok:.	To be prepared for Covid next year
Nov 17 15:14:21 .:richardbanger:.	whats covid?
Nov 17 15:14:39 .:likeafox:.	Invest in toilet paper too, fill your garage with it
Nov 17 15:14:59 .:likeafox:.	you'll be able to sell it for big return
Nov 17 15:15:27 .:chowbok:.	Ooh, yeah, good point
Nov 17 15:15:32 .:chowbok:.	And hand sanitizer
Nov 17 15:18:21 .:live1:.	linux iso files are #2 on my doomsday list, #1 being windows iso files (lies)
Nov 17 15:20:53 .:Blok:.	hodapp: Yes, fails before first line of execution in main()
Nov 17 15:59:12 .:RedCrow:.	How much space should I keep for the root partition?
Nov 17 15:59:17 .:RedCrow:.	I mean optimally!
Nov 17 15:59:31 .:Dagmar:.	RedCrow: 75% free
Nov 17 16:00:06 .:RedCrow:.	I kept 20 GB and now I get notifications about space
Nov 17 16:00:13 .:Dagmar:.	If you _really_ want to know, make it HUGE and install Linux, then go _look_ at how much it used, reformat and install again
Nov 17 16:00:30 .:Dagmar:.	Make /home separate
Nov 17 16:00:45 .:Khaytsus:.	How much / changes also depends on how many other partitions you have... /usr /home /var etc will make / vary less.
Nov 17 16:00:46 .:Dagmar:.	It will save you a lot of prolbems
Nov 17 16:00:57 .:Dagmar:.	(not /etc.  /etc needs to be in /)
Nov 17 16:01:13 .:Khaytsus:.	I did not say /etc but yes that was unintentionaly misleading
Nov 17 16:01:19 .:Dagmar:.	I know.  heh
Nov 17 16:01:33 .:Dagmar:.	There's no easy way to make "eyes bugged" a text format
Nov 17 16:02:30 .:Dagmar:.	For a slim server install I'll sometimes use as little as 6Gb for /, but that's with somewhat obese distributions
Nov 17 16:02:41 .:Dagmar:.	Mayube 20Gb for a desktop
Nov 17 16:02:44 .:RedCrow:.	20 GB — 2.0 GB free (89.9% full)
Nov 17 16:03:03 .:Dagmar:.	A 20Gb / is a ridiculous amount of space
Nov 17 16:03:31 .:Dagmar:.	You can pretty much fit every little X app your heart desires in there
Nov 17 16:04:16 .:Khaytsus:.	Some distros don't want /usr separate anymore
Nov 17 16:04:26 .:RedCrow:.	Can I log in to my linux edition through an USB stick and manually edit the partition?
Nov 17 16:04:59 .:RedCrow:.	*Linux
Nov 17 16:05:21 .:Khaytsus:.	There are live gedit iso's etc, sure, you can do that.  If you can.
Nov 17 16:05:22 .:Dagmar:.	Well, there's not a lot of utility in keeping /usr separate from / unless you're trying to like, use one common /usr among a bunch of virtuals
Nov 17 16:05:58 .:RedCrow:.	I mean obviously I can't edit the root partition while it is active, right?
Nov 17 16:06:11 .:Dagmar:.	Under certain circumstances you can
Nov 17 16:06:27 .:Dagmar:.	Like, if your'e using LVM and you're enlarging it... that's trivial
Nov 17 16:06:46 .:Dagmar:.	Moving the start of it or shrinking it... definitely not to be done online
Nov 17 16:06:51 .:RedCrow:.	Thus without a LVM my task is impossible?
Nov 17 16:07:30 .:Dagmar:.	Without LVM most of hte same restrictions apply.  If you're enlarging it by moving the end, it's fine, it just needs you to slap the kernel with partprobe/kpartx after editing the partition table
Nov 17 16:08:00 .:Dagmar:.	Not that many people have free contiguous space on the disk following their root filesystem tho
Nov 17 16:11:39 .:HiccupJul:.	is there a tool that can find duplicate files and then combine the filenames of all the dupes into one?
Nov 17 16:12:00 .:HiccupJul:.	e.g. if you had a b and c with the same contents, it would replace those files with abc
Nov 17 16:12:08 .:Khaytsus:.	symlink them all to one or something?
Nov 17 16:12:10 .:HiccupJul:.	or maybe "a; b; c"
Nov 17 16:12:12 .:Dagmar:.	List them, yes.  Destroy them, yes.  Anything else is up to you.
Nov 17 16:12:28 .:Khaytsus:.	find_duplicates is a common tool for finding
Nov 17 16:12:36 .:HiccupJul:.	yeah i used fdupes to make a list
Nov 17 16:12:58 .:HiccupJul:.	and i'm writing the combining logic in python, but i was wondering if there was a quicker solution
Nov 17 16:13:03 .:Khaytsus:.	Oops yes fdupes
Nov 17 16:13:41 .:Khaytsus:.	but sounds like you need some very specialized thing, so you'll have to wrap around fdupes most likely.
Nov 17 16:14:03 .:HiccupJul:.	yeah
Nov 17 16:16:15 .:Dagmar:.	If you intend to write to these files in the future, this might be a bad idea
Nov 17 16:16:25 .:Dagmar:.	Changing one will change all the duplicates as well after you do this
Nov 17 16:16:44 .:Dagmar:.	If this is basically a bunch of read-only files on the same filesystem, then you can just use hardlinks
Nov 17 16:17:15 .:HiccupJul:.	well i don't want to use symlinks/hardlinks
Nov 17 16:17:18 .:Dagmar:.	Having written a deduplicator of my own, fdupes is f**king fast
Nov 17 16:17:26 .:HiccupJul:.	i just want to rename a to abc, and then delete b and c
Nov 17 16:17:47 .:Khaytsus:.	I wish it could exclude file extensions..
Nov 17 16:18:26 .:Dagmar:.	Hopefully you won't run into problems with filename lengths, because this sounds like another case of "Mistakenly treating a filesystem like a database"
Nov 17 16:19:10 .:HiccupJul:.	i think i already ran into that issue
Nov 17 16:19:31 .:HiccupJul:.	so yeah, i guess a better aproach would be to just remove dupes and have a txt file
Nov 17 16:19:51 .:HiccupJul:.	i.e. a txt file with the output of fdupes
Nov 17 16:20:10 .:Dagmar:.	...or to just store it all in a database to begin with
Nov 17 16:20:14 .:Dagmar:.	SQL ain't that hard
Nov 17 16:20:37 .:Dagmar:.	(although it's definitely homely)
Nov 17 16:21:08 .:HiccupJul:.	well i'm working with the output of a program that just spits out some files
Nov 17 16:21:23 .:HiccupJul:.	but yeah database could work instead of txt
Nov 17 16:21:36 .:HiccupJul:.	although its for a static website so txt (or html) is probably best
Nov 17 16:23:08 .:Khaytsus:.	Wouldn't you just nuke the old output if it's a static website generator
Nov 17 16:35:28 .:live1:.	sometimes it feels like my OS is being virtualized. think it's due to the powerful hardware and the OS "barely touching it". using openbox only, cpu runs mostly at lower freq, hardly every fill out more than half or RAM space.
Nov 17 16:36:03 .:scarf:.	Every intel processor post 2007 has an embedded minix OS in it.
Nov 17 16:37:11 .:scarf:.	I guess you could say that unix really won the OS wars. Because literally everyone is running unix in a subtle way.
Nov 17 16:37:41 .:live1:.	that is my second guess, naturally one thinks that "they'll" virtualize all free OSes. but, heh, that' me utter _s-it_. screw the privacy thing, i want _real_ performance, _real_ instruction execution, not virtualized.
Nov 17 16:41:55 .:scarf:.	live1, what are you doing that you need full pedal to the metal?
Nov 17 16:44:19 .:BluesKaj:.	Hi all
Nov 17 16:44:30 .:live1:.	i'm doing normal programming work. the idea of the OS being virtualized is utter nonsense. computers don't work that way, i don't want an emulation layer in between the hardware and my OS.
Nov 17 16:45:00 .:scarf:.	I'm afraid there is nothing you can do about it other than run hardware from 2005.
Nov 17 16:46:04 .:live1:.	suspecting Windows is having standard hardware access, as it's closed source. but this is pure s-it. alternatives are thinkpads or coreboot/libreboot supported hardware. alternative also is me_cleaner.
Nov 17 16:46:19 .:live1:.	but at this point, this is all assumption.
Nov 17 16:47:11 .:live1:.	it'd be a fun research topic.
Nov 17 16:47:14 .:scarf:.	I think windows enforces emulation layers, it's not the DOS era anymore to where you can run your i386 in real mode.
Nov 17 16:49:37 .:live1:.	i'm refering to modern hardware and windows in that context.
Nov 17 16:49:50 .:hangint3n:.	hey, anyone know where you can get those wire clips for AMD Ryzen coolers? I managed to break one while upgrading...
Nov 17 16:50:00 .:scarf:.	Who knows what's going on behind the scenes with modern intel chips. You literally have a 2nd OS running under the hood.
Nov 17 16:50:06 .:live1:.	eg. it's closed source so it can have direct access to the hardware, without any kind of (suspected) virtualization or emulation.
Nov 17 16:50:46 .:Khaytsus:.	hangint3n: Might ask in #hardware
Nov 17 16:51:00 .:hangint3n:.	k
Nov 17 16:51:07 .:live1:.	scarf, you're using AMD chips?
Nov 17 16:51:14 .:hangint3n:.	will do
Nov 17 16:51:55 .:scarf:.	No I'm on intel live1. I think AMD has something similar to what intel does, just not as extensive.
Nov 17 16:53:15 .:live1:.	privacy/spying would be the secondary issue. main problem is _my_ OS being virtualized! ah. well...
Nov 17 16:53:55 .:Khaytsus:.	Your OS is not virtualized, why do you keep saying that
Nov 17 16:55:24 .:live1:.	it is an assumption. we were talking about intel ME and such.
Nov 17 16:55:38 .:Khaytsus:.	there's #Linux-offtopic for..  random nonsense.  Just saying.
Nov 17 16:56:26 .:live1:.	sure. it isn't random nonsense. the context would reveal that.
Nov 17 16:57:28 .:scarf:.	I can't wait until libreoffice has 1:1 compatibility with docx and the rest. But that might not be for a few years from now. They're getting close, but no cigar.
Nov 17 17:02:43 .:hangint3n:.	So after upgrading my system from a AMD Ryzen 1800x and 2666mhz ram to a Asus Tuf X570 Plus, AMD Ryzen 9 5950x and 3600mhz ram I did a compile test of firefox. The results where 10:58 that cut is a 50% decrease in compile time. Very happy with the results.
Nov 17 17:05:22 .:peetaur:.	don't worry, as CPU performance increases, the bloat will too and your compile times will be back to normal
Nov 17 17:06:11 .:live1:.	i did mention intel ME thing as a secondary guess. first guess was powerful hardware. the system is running fine overall, with no any kind of troubles, for years now. is very suitable for programming work. and it has enough resources to host _another_ programmer to do its work.
Nov 17 17:06:31 .:hangint3n:.	peetaur: Well that is a depressing thought
Nov 17 17:06:57 .:peetaur:.	;)
Nov 17 17:08:25 .:hangint3n:.	peetaur: I'm hoping that I'm at maximum bloatage now.
Nov 17 17:09:07 .:peetaur:.	what is maximum bloat is relative to the developer's impression of their user's hardware and their own hardware ...it increases over time
Nov 17 17:09:44 .:peetaur:.	remeber that systemd thing... they disabled some readahead thing to make boot faster, and hdd users complained it got really slow, and then WONTFIX "works find on our RH developer machines with SSD"
Nov 17 17:10:17 .:scarf:.	Systemd is a disaster, but it's pointless to complain about at this point. It won.
Nov 17 17:10:57 .:hangint3n:.	I never adopted systemd. What I have works so I've no need to change.
Nov 17 17:11:22 .:suid_dumpable:.	hangint3n: so which distro do you use?
Nov 17 17:11:42 .:hangint3n:.	Gentoo gives you the option of systemd and openrc
Nov 17 17:11:53 .:scarf:.	I've thought about adopting slackware myself, but there are select snap packages I really like and sadly that requires systemd. Oh well.
Nov 17 17:12:21 .:hangint3n:.	that is always the catch.
Nov 17 17:12:29 .:peetaur:.	my distro adopted systemd... and then immediately what I had didn't work, so I had to change  :D
Nov 17 17:12:50 .:live1:.	wasn't really paying much attention to systemd discussion. but straying away from UNIX philosophy and building one big blob of a program were enough indicators to me for switching to a nonsystemd system. altough i'd run a standard debian (with systemd) without any complaints.

Nov 17 17:13:13 .:live1:.	nosystemd.org is a neat resource for switching.
Nov 17 17:13:32 .:scarf:.	I wouldn't say I *love* snap, it's almost a full time job to avoid systemd at this point.
Nov 17 17:13:53 .:peetaur:.	luckily there are distros that do that full time job for you... like devuan and artix
Nov 17 17:14:12 .:scarf:.	Yeah devuan is pretty cool.
Nov 17 17:14:29 .:Arthur:.	Hello
Nov 17 17:14:39 .:hangint3n:.	I'm hoping Gentoo continues to support an alternative,  but who knows what is the mind of the developers
Nov 17 17:15:12 .:scarf:.	I think someday that even gentoo will accept this isn't a hill worth dying on.
Nov 17 17:16:34 .:Thuryn:.	i, too, think systemd is kind of stupid and falls heavily into the "second system syndrome" category, but the tide was too strong to resist so w/e
Nov 17 17:16:40 .:hangint3n:.	that might be true. we shall see.

Nov 17 17:16:50 .:Thuryn:.	trying to talk to people about it is like telling people they don't need swap
Nov 17 17:16:54 .:Thuryn:.	they just lose their minds
Nov 17 17:11:58 .:woland:.	scarf: you have to hear artix devs moaning about how bad devuan is 
Nov 17 17:17:19 .:hangint3n:.	you dont need swap?
Nov 17 17:17:42 .:Thuryn:.	hangint3n, no.  it's nice to have, but it's not a requirement.
Nov 17 17:17:55 .:marcgizmo:.	hello, does anyone know an example or documentation to parse PKCS#11 URI to openssl in C/C++ ?
Nov 17 17:18:00 .:Thuryn:.	and it some fairly rare cases, it is a waste of resources that adds nothing.
Nov 17 17:18:05 .:scarf:.	I see a lot of FUD and strong hyperbole about canonical and snaps. Anything under the universe (which is like what, 98% of ubuntu packages) will never be touched. Canonical likes the community to be involved, and will keep the vast majority as a regular deb.
Nov 17 17:18:19 .:suid_dumpable:.	running debian here, so i have systemd. the only problem i have with systemd is that it is taking over too much non-init related tasks like ntp, network configuration, etc.
Nov 17 17:18:36 .:hangint3n:.	oh, cause when i process a 4gb video it sure comes in handy.
Nov 17 17:19:15 <peetaur>	woland: artix devs don't seem to moan about devian or even mention it at all
Nov 17 17:19:38 .:hodapp:.	I mean, yes, it's not a requirement if a system simply failing at its job is an option.
Nov 17 17:19:45 .:hodapp:.	in which case literally nothing is a requirement.
Nov 17 17:19:49 .:hodapp:.	depends on the system, however.
Nov 17 17:19:50 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, nonsense.
Nov 17 17:14:31 .:woland:.	peetaur: join their telegam and mention devuan 
Nov 17 17:19:53 .:hangint3n:.	gotcha
Nov 17 17:20:05 .:Thuryn:.	see?  people have weird very strong and absolute opinions about it.
Nov 17 17:20:16 .:Thuryn:.	almost religious, you might say.
Nov 17 17:20:29 .:scarf:.	It's human to hold very strong opinions on things Thuryn.
Nov 17 17:20:32 .:hangint3n:.	change is hard
Nov 17 17:20:38 .:peetaur:.	and only trouble I ever had with devuan is when some stupid install script hardcodes  if ..... = "Debian"   ..... else  ... says it doesn't recognize     where you just put -o ....="Devaun" and it works fine
Nov 17 17:20:57 .:Thuryn:.	scarf, yes.
Nov 17 17:21:40 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: I work in an environment with quite a number of shared servers running heavy jobs - typically long-running training jobs in R&D where runaway memory is not that uncommon. It is quite a priority here that such jobs continue to run, albeit far more slowly, and likely work out their own issues, rather than simply having processes die.
Nov 17 17:21:58 .:hangint3n:.	software affinity is like religion lol
Nov 17 17:22:17 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: You might actually consider people's real-world experiences before getting on a high horse with some abstract point about opinions - particularly opinions you've not even cared to listen to.
Nov 17 17:22:52 .:Khaytsus:.	One might say spending endless time and limiting yourself to a few distros to avoid systemd is also a bit zealous.
Nov 17 17:23:13 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, everything I said is from real-world experience.
Nov 17 17:23:33 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, I work in an environment that supports 50,000 users.  I'm pretty sure I know what i'm talking about.
Nov 17 17:23:51 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, the case where you don't need swap is nothing like the use case you mentioned.
Nov 17 17:24:07 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: Oh, okay, so now suddenly the situation matters.
Nov 17 17:24:14 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, I never said it didn't.
Nov 17 17:24:26 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: Funny that you're repeating my own opinion back to me, but now pretending like it's some kind of revelation.
Nov 17 17:24:33 .:Thuryn:.	What I said is that it's not the requirement people think it is every time you have a discussion about it.
Nov 17 17:24:40 .:Thuryn:.	Way to prove the point.
Nov 17 17:24:48 .:Thuryn:.	People jump to conclusions and get pissy about it.
Nov 17 17:24:54 .:nero:.	oh, we are currently having an outage at work due to missing swao
Nov 17 17:24:56 .:nero:.	*swap
Nov 17 17:25:20 .:nero:.	turns out if you load 150 MB of go binaries, they are still named pages
Nov 17 17:25:21 .:Khaytsus:.	Missing swap?  wut?
Nov 17 17:25:25 .:Thuryn:.	This issue went so far as to create problems in the kernel at one point on systems where swap was disabled.
Nov 17 17:25:26 .:hangint3n:.	ouch!
Nov 17 17:25:37 .:Thuryn:.	People got so thoroughly used to it that they forgot it's not always needed.
Nov 17 17:25:37 .:nero:.	so we got swap enabled
Nov 17 17:25:46 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: You said it's "not a requirement", completely unqualified.
Nov 17 17:26:00 .:nero:.	the go binaries consumed all the memory for their heap and their own code is being discarded from memory and read back in at 2 gb/s
Nov 17 17:26:01 .:Thuryn:.	hodapp, so if you were smart, you'd qualify it before mouthig off.
Nov 17 17:26:14 .:Thuryn:.	But instead, you chose to take it as an absolute and go nuts.
Nov 17 17:26:20 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: I'm not the one who made completely unqualified assertions. That was you.
Nov 17 17:26:27 .:Thuryn:.	Never mind the context of the discussion, which was as a tangent to something else.
Nov 17 17:26:29 .:Khaytsus:.	Can we not?
Nov 17 17:26:34 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: That was also you who gave some sanctimonious shit about people's opinions always being wrong.
Nov 17 17:26:45 .:Thuryn:.	/ignore hodapp No point in this.
Nov 17 17:26:55 .:Thuryn:.	So anyway.
Nov 17 17:26:57 .:hodapp:.	Thuryn: Don't come in on a high horse and then get pissy about how far you fell.
Nov 17 17:27:43 .:nero:.	true
Nov 17 17:28:20 .:nero:.	with swap, it would have been a temporary performance degradation since the heap usage is part of a load spike
Nov 17 17:28:25 .:Thuryn:.	So the case I ran into where swap wasn't needed was the enterprise DNS servers.  It was never, ever used.
Nov 17 17:28:39 .:scarf:.	It's really silly to get so tied up about Unix philosophy in 2022 when it was made in the 60s/70s. Doing one thing only just doesn't work anymore, GIMP certainly does more than one thing for example.
Nov 17 17:28:54 .:Thuryn:.	The requirements for memory were internally limited.  It *could* not go higher than what was spec'd.
Nov 17 17:29:03 .:lericson:.	i have 128GB RAM
Nov 17 17:29:06 .:lericson:.	how large should my swap be
Nov 17 17:29:11 .:hodapp:.	nero: we're just always having some derpy research job accidentally allocate way too much memory because someone forgot something was O(n^2) - but it beats the job tripping OOM on someone's training job that's been running for 2 weeks and is for a very important delivery or something
Nov 17 17:29:12 .:nero:.	so a DNS server is a good case where you can get away with having no swap
Nov 17 17:29:16 .:Thuryn:.	lericson, depends on what you're using it for
Nov 17 17:29:44 .:hodapp:.	nero: luckily, though, we don't have any people at the company that are militant about swap not being a requirement
Nov 17 17:29:46 .:Thuryn:.	nero, yeah.  that or a DHCP server or some embedded devices... basically not having that random user-induced element is pretty much a requirement.
Nov 17 17:30:04 .:lericson:.	Thuryn: experiments
Nov 17 17:30:11 .:nero:.	the service we are having trouble with is some gitlab microservice with user-induced loads
Nov 17 17:30:15 .:lericson:.	i have run it out of memory several times
Nov 17 17:30:25 .:nero:.	but gitlab is banana software anyways
Nov 17 17:30:26 .:Thuryn:.	lericson, what's "it"?
Nov 17 17:30:42 .:hodapp:.	nero: we run gitlab too and it's........ yeah
Nov 17 17:31:03 .:bigshot00:.	if i mount harddisk drive in fstab, will 'fstrim' function also try to trim spinning harddisk?
Nov 17 17:31:06 .:Thuryn:.	nero, yeah anything involving users without some interesting and sturdy quotas - which is a lot of work - demands swap as a backstop.
Nov 17 17:31:07 .:bigshot00:.	ubuntu server here
Nov 17 17:31:25 .:Thuryn:.	though even then, if your process is running amok, having swap is just delaying the inevitable.  OOM means OOM.
Nov 17 17:31:29 .:lericson:.	bigshot00: pretty sure you can't trim a spinning rust disk?
Nov 17 17:31:37 .:bigshot00:.	huih?
Nov 17 17:31:44 .:nero:.	not amok, just a load spike
Nov 17 17:31:47 .:Thuryn:.	bbiab.  time to drive.
Nov 17 17:31:49 .:nero:.	until the request is served
Nov 17 17:32:09 .:bigshot00:.	what to do so that fstrim function is not called on spinnning harddisk?
Nov 17 17:33:19 .:nero:.	do HDD's even support the trim command?
Nov 17 17:33:24 .:hodapp:.	pretty sure they don't
Nov 17 17:33:25 .:lericson:.	bigshot00: i am telling you that it won't trim non-trimmable devices
Nov 17 17:33:27 .:bigshot00:.	dunno man

Nov 17 17:41:02 .:ananke:.	[twisti]: either the storage device itself is malfunctioning, or the usb enclosure. your best bet is to either get access to smart data (this will show if the device itself was having problems), or by testing each of those components individually

Nov 17 17:45:12 .:peetaur:.	bigshot00: you can simply `fstrim -a` in cron or however else and it'll do what you need... it should do all disks and just ignore errors otherwise you will miss things; eg. ceph RBD is rotational (eg. `find /sys -name "*rotational*" -exec grep -H . {} +`) (and maybe other thin provisioning is the same), but fstrim will reclaim unused space
Nov 17 17:45:15 .:tuxick:.	got a nice zabbix graph showing a shedload of fstrims kicking in

Nov 17 17:45:49 .:ananke:.	[twisti]: if you can find the file/directory, you _could_ try to use rsync to copy it off the device. rsync supports rate limiting, so you would get that 'try to do it slowly' approach
Nov 17 17:45:49 .:scarf:.	tuxick, If it's not a security issue, it will always be put on the backburner. Any distro does that.
Nov 17 17:46:12 .:tuxick:.	i could cook up a playboko

Nov 17 17:55:55 .:CrtxReavr:.	Oracle Cloud instance has an hd(4) man page: hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices
Nov 17 17:56:12 .:Sauvin:.	CrtxReavr, yeah, that one. I've got that, and no clue why. I have no such drives.
Nov 17 17:56:19 .:lericson:.	i'm going to make a hexdump program that actually does use base 6
Nov 17 17:56:30 .:live1:.	whatis on my system points to MFM/IDE hard disk devices too, and hexdump

Nov 17 17:56:37 .:ananke:.	lericson: sixdump?
Nov 17 17:56:43 .:Sauvin:.	lericson, how do you plan on handling the moduli?
Nov 17 17:56:45 .:CrtxReavr:.	Sauvin, IDE/MFM support tends to be aroudn by default.
Nov 17 17:57:00 .:hodapp:.	CrtxReavr: despite MFM disks being looooong gone?
Nov 17 17:57:04 .:ayecee:.	okay well i guess we've learned something today about utility names
Nov 17 17:57:08 .:lericson:.	it's an outrage that hexdump uses hexaDECIMAL, it's like calling 100 "ten" because it's shorter
Nov 17 17:57:10 .:Khaytsus:.	I keep an /mp3 on my 10M MFM drive.
Nov 17 17:57:15 .:lericson:.	so i aim to put that right
Nov 17 17:57:16 .:Khaytsus:.	erm, an mp3, not /mp3 ;)
Nov 17 17:57:23 .:CrtxReavr:.	MFM drives were crazy fast for their day. . .
Nov 17 17:57:32 .:ayecee:.	CrtxReavr: does your hexdump manpage list hd as an alternate way to call it?
Nov 17 17:57:40 .:ayecee:.	mine does
Nov 17 17:57:42 .:Khaytsus:.	Faster than floppies, I dunno about 'crazy fast'
Nov 17 17:57:46 .:lericson:.	also who uses hexdump and not xxd?
Nov 17 17:57:52 .:ayecee:.	people, mostly.
Nov 17 17:57:54 .:Khaytsus:.	I use od
Nov 17 17:57:55 .:ayecee:.	people use hexdump.
Nov 17 17:57:56 .:Khaytsus:.	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Nov 17 17:58:12 .:lericson:.	jesus how many hexdump tools are there on your average linux install
Nov 17 17:58:12 .:live1:.	i use hd

Nov 17 17:58:18 .:CrtxReavr:.	ayecee, no, nor is there anything called hd in my path.
Nov 17 17:58:18 .:Sauvin:.	I've got a collection of hex dumpers, but they don't do any good when I'm feeling hexed.
Nov 17 17:58:29 .:hexnewbie:.	I have not seen a human person hexdump, if we don't count unsuccessful attempts before switching to a tool that works
Nov 17 17:58:30 .:hodapp:.	it's not like hexdump tools are hefty
Nov 17 17:58:46 .:ayecee:.	CrtxReavr: well then. i see it here on ubuntu 22.04. i wonder if it was there on 20.04.
Nov 17 17:58:54 .:lericson:.	oh xxd is the vim-brand one i guess
Nov 17 17:58:57 .:lericson:.	explains why i use it
Nov 17 17:59:11 .:Sauvin:.	That last dump I took was certainly hexed enough.

Nov 17 18:00:10 .:lericson:.	that's the advantage of comic books, you can just look at the pictures
Nov 17 18:00:26 .:ayecee:.	that's an advantage, is it
Nov 17 18:00:29 .:Sauvin:.	No, we don't read them anymore. We _watch_ them. All kinds of movies coming from the Marvel and DC Universes.

Nov 17 18:01:34 .:hexnewbie:.	Let me half-retract that, I do use hexdump to detect if a drive is all-zeroes. Since all-zeroes are the only thing that hexdump displays correctly.
Nov 17 18:01:47 .:hodapp:.	...what
Nov 17 18:01:48 .:ayecee:.	"correctly"
Nov 17 18:01:55 .:Sauvin:.	Thing about "watching" a book rather than "reading" it is that you don't get nearly as much detail, character development and the like. Mostly, you just get a lot of BIFF! BOOM! KAPOW! and maybe some bazooms.
Nov 17 18:02:13 .:tuxick:.	Jesus is very forgiving if you install hydraukic suspension for him

Nov 17 18:03:50 .:hexnewbie:.	Well, for anyone who has eyes to see it differs from the correct output 😜
Nov 17 18:03:56 .:Sauvin:.	hexnewbie, you normally make all kinds of good sense. Today, maybe not as much.
Nov 17 18:03:57 .:ayecee:.	"correct"
Nov 17 18:04:21 .:ayecee:.	fwiw i'd usually use hexdump -C, for the canonical experience.
Nov 17 18:04:23 .:lericson:.	hexnewbie: i'm with you brother

Nov 17 18:04:41 .:lericson:.	although that is usually not a good sign
Nov 17 18:04:47 .:Sauvin:.	Oh, that's not "correct" or "incorrect", it's got ENDIANNESS!
Nov 17 18:05:07 .:lericson:.	lol wut
Nov 17 18:05:27 .:ayecee:.	hexnewbie: now try hexdump -C
Nov 17 18:06:04 .:lericson:.	this reminds me of a skit, but it's in swedish

Nov 17 18:08:59 .:ayecee:.	hey now
Nov 17 18:09:00 .:hodapp:.	probably because 90% of the boomer jokes are like "HAH HAH TAXES SUCK" and "HAH HAH MY WIFE SUCKS"

Nov 17 18:09:14 .:hexnewbie:.	Sauvin: But that's the thing, my files are made of bytes, sometimes they are not an *even* number of bytes, they can't have endianess. Even if they had, they could be made of 64 bit numbers with endianess, not 16 bit.

Nov 17 18:11:24 .:live1:.	so you're going to tell me "endianess" is not an abstract term?
Nov 17 18:11:31 .:live1:.	and nobody uses "endianess" in practice?
Nov 17 18:11:35 .:hexnewbie:.	live1: Anyway, you need to know where the reading starts and ends to be able to read it back and forth
Nov 17 18:11:40 .:ayecee:.	i'm going to tell you that endianness doesn't mean that in practical terms.
Nov 17 18:11:56 .:live1:.	tomatoes tomatos...
Nov 17 18:11:57 .:lericson:.	shouldn't the numbers be all wrong also if it actually was flipped endianness?
Nov 17 18:12:11 .:live1:.	sure, one needs to know byte size.
Nov 17 18:12:11 .:ayecee:.	when we talk about a little-endian computer, the least significant _byte_ is first, not _bit_
Nov 17 18:12:25 .:ayecee:.	there we go, walk back those goal posts
Nov 17 18:12:52 .:live1:.	well fine, we're both correct.
Nov 17 18:13:01 .:ayecee:.	no we're not.
Nov 17 18:13:17 .:live1:.	bytes is just abstraction over bits. so endianess = bits.
Nov 17 18:13:30 .:live1:.	bytes = 8 bits
Nov 17 18:13:40 .:live1:.	we're both corect.
Nov 17 18:13:45 .:ayecee:.	no we're not.
Nov 17 18:13:56 .:live1:.	sure, we're not. i understand your point, if that matters.
Nov 17 18:14:18 .:ayecee:.	if you enter a conversation where a term is being used one way, and you raise an objection using an arbitrary definition from a different field, you're wrong.

Nov 17 18:29:25 .:Khaytsus:.	Seriously Arthur
Nov 17 18:29:25 .:ayecee:.	how to do what
Nov 17 18:29:28 .:lericson:.	is this a joke Arthur

Nov 17 18:30:49 .:Arthur:.	the hexdump command, i can dump the values and adress of my physical memory using 'hd /dev/mem'
Nov 17 18:31:04 .:ayecee:.	ok?
Nov 17 18:31:04 .:Arthur:.	But i want a specific part of the ram memory
Nov 17 18:31:14 .:ayecee:.	ok?
Nov 17 18:31:16 .:ayecee:.	so how to do what
Nov 17 18:31:34 .:lericson:.	which, believe it or not, does flip the bytes :D
Nov 17 18:31:40 .:Arthur:.	Like the firefox values allocated here

Nov 17 18:32:17 .:Arthur:.	In the ram bro hahahaha
Nov 17 18:32:18 .:rascul:.	i guess you would use the --skip and --length options as described in the man page
Nov 17 18:32:28 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: if you're gesturing at your computer i can't see it.
Nov 17 18:32:31 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: so, how to do what
Nov 17 18:32:45 .:lericson:.	this is incredible, od -x also changes the byte order
Nov 17 18:32:45 .:Khaytsus:.	He mentioned something about dumping memory from a pid
Nov 17 18:32:56 .:ayecee:.	did he?
Nov 17 18:32:59 .:Arthur:.	Yes Khaytsus, you're smart
Nov 17 18:33:14 .:Arthur:.	Dumping memory from a pid, just this
Nov 17 18:33:16 .:Khaytsus:.	ayecee: Yes, before he ghosted everyone into a useless 20 minute convo about nothing.
Nov 17 18:33:23 .:ayecee:.	ah.
Nov 17 18:33:26 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: can't do that.
Nov 17 18:33:38 .:Arthur:.	I'm sorry, im using hexchat at work so i cant be reading all time
Nov 17 18:33:38 .:lericson:.	ah od is related to hd
Nov 17 18:33:53 .:lericson:.	well it is the new name apparently
Nov 17 18:34:04 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: can't do that with hd and /dev/mem at least.
Nov 17 18:34:29 .:ayecee:.	maybe you can use gdb instead to generate a core dump.
Nov 17 18:34:37 .:Arthur:.	Hm
Nov 17 18:34:48 .:rascul:.	od isn't the new hd
Nov 17 18:34:52 .:Khaytsus:.	https://davidebove.com/blog/2021/03/27/how-to-dump-process-memory-in-linux/
Nov 17 18:35:28 .:Arthur:.	Using python.....
Nov 17 18:35:35 .:Khaytsus:.	Or you can google yourself?
Nov 17 18:35:42 .:Khaytsus:.	https://google.com/search?q=linux+dump+ram+of+pid
Nov 17 18:35:57 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: yes, you can also use python.
Nov 17 18:35:57 .:Arthur:.	So, it's not possible to do it in pure shell?
Nov 17 18:36:09 .:ayecee:.	Arthur: not in any reasonable way, no.
Nov 17 18:36:10 .:Khaytsus:.	If you can do it in python you can do it bash
Nov 17 18:36:16 .:rascul:.	sure it is but you certainly shouldn't do it in pure shell
Nov 17 18:37:34 .:ayecee:.	rascul: don't know if it makes a difference, but the hexdump manpage said posix.2 / ieee 1003.2, while this webpage is posix.1-2017 / ieee 1003.1-2017
Nov 17 18:37:36 .:Arthur:.	Okay thanks
Nov 17 18:37:44 .:madprops:.	what's the program to create zip files?
Nov 17 18:37:46 .:lericson:.	Khaytsus: not so sure about that tbh
Nov 17 18:37:51 .:lericson:.	madprops: called zip
Nov 17 18:37:51 .:rascul:.	ayecee posix.2 seems to be an ancient thing from the '90s

Nov 17 18:42:05 .:ayecee:.	i don't know of a feature that would keep a screen turned off just because the display was black
Nov 17 18:42:33 .:ayecee:.	but it sounds like it doesn't turn on again after going to sleep

Nov 17 18:43:38 .:ayecee:.	what we need is a rubegoldberg-style alarm clock to wake it up again like lericson uses to wake himself
Nov 17 18:43:40 .:rascul:.	i find no mention of hexdump or hd in old posix
Nov 17 18:43:51 .:rascul:.	i think the man page is lying, unless it means maybe it conforms to od specs
Nov 17 18:43:56 .:rascul:.	it doesn't specify
Nov 17 18:44:06 .:ayecee:.	perhaps it means with regards to the format specifiers.
Nov 17 18:44:12 .:rascul:.	oh, maybe
Nov 17 18:44:22 .:rascul:.	i rather like the idea that man pages are full of lies, though
Nov 17 18:44:39 .:chiselfuse:.	ayecee: ok so what worked right now is (the monitor still plugged in and sleepy)  i did:     xset dpms force on; sleep 2; xset dpms force off;   then Xrandr was reset so i had to type in command to configure it as extended display again with xrandr(1)
Nov 17 18:44:43 .:Thuryn:.	rascul, i prefer to think of it as "wishful thinking"

Nov 17 18:45:35 .:ayecee:.	where X was the output to wake.
Nov 17 18:46:15 .:ayecee:.	not a fix, but i wonder if that workaround also works for you, as it would suggest that it's the same problem at least.
Nov 17 18:46:18 .:rascul:.	ayecee oh i read it again in the man page, it only says it's compatible, not that it's part of the standard
Nov 17 18:46:18 .:chiselfuse:.	ayecee: now i have to wait 10 minutes for a single try... v painful
Nov 17 18:46:28 .:ayecee:.	rascul: aha
Nov 17 18:46:31 .:chiselfuse:.	how do i force it to sleep
Nov 17 18:46:39 .:rascul:.	aha (1)              - Convert ANSI escape sequences to HTML
Nov 17 18:46:45 .:rascul:.	i don't know if aha is very useful with hexdump?
Nov 17 18:46:55 .:ayecee:.	chiselfuse: lock the screen? that shuts my monitors down quick.
Nov 17 18:47:47 .:lericson:.	aha --take-on-me
Nov 17 18:48:43 .:ayecee:.	the aha easter egg
Nov 17 18:48:50 .:rascul:.	xset can do it
Nov 17 18:49:22 .:rascul:.	'xset dpms force something' where 'something' is `standby', `suspend', `off', or `on'
Nov 17 18:49:32 .:rascul:.	one of those choices might be what you would expect sleep to be
Nov 17 18:49:49 .:ayecee:.	i wonder if the screensaver is turning off the output instead of turning off the monitor by dpms
Nov 17 18:50:02 .:kulak:.	Can someone point to a good resource on Arch based distributions?
Nov 17 18:50:08 .:rascul:.	arch wiki
Nov 17 18:50:14 .:ayecee:.	wiki.archlinux.org
Nov 17 18:50:18 .:rascul:.	yep that one
Nov 17 18:50:25 »»	rascul points to that url
Nov 17 18:53:37 .:chiselfuse:.	ayecee: i don't have lock program installed, i have dwm as wm and that's all
Nov 17 18:54:01 .:ayecee:.	well i mean something is locking the screen right
Nov 17 18:54:18 .:Successus:.	hi, recently this problem started happening, I copy some normal string from firefox (not an image as some of the search results say) and then try to paste it and I get the error 'target STRING not available'. The problem is that I can't paste. I need to wait a bit or to select another string in Parcellite in order to paste what I want. How to solve this?
Nov 17 18:54:55 .:ayecee:.	Successus: does it happen every time you copy and paste or only sometimes
Nov 17 18:54:56 .:Successus:.	it seems that even if I use xsel, it won't paste sometimes
Nov 17 18:55:01 .:Successus:.	no only sometimes
Nov 17 18:55:12 .:ayecee:.	does it happen on every site or only some sites
Nov 17 18:55:25 .:rascul:.	does it happen without parcellite running?
Nov 17 18:55:40 .:Successus:.	I haven't tried without parcellite, but I will not stop using parcellite
Nov 17 18:55:49 .:Successus:.	I don't know on what sites it happens
Nov 17 18:56:02 .:ayecee:.	could you try not using parcellite to see if it's related to parcellite
Nov 17 18:56:15 .:Successus:.	I could
Nov 17 18:56:32 .:chiselfuse:.	ayecee: dwm locks it after a timeout i think? i'll try looking for value in src and recompile to 10 seconds or something to test
Nov 17 18:57:01 .:ayecee:.	chiselfuse: i bet there's a way to do that without recompiling, if it is indeed dwm that's doing the locking.
Nov 17 18:57:37 .:ayecee:.	Successus: anyhow, no obvious reason for that to happen, so we're kinda spitballing ways to narrow down the potential causes.
Nov 17 18:58:10 .:ayecee:.	it'd be nice if there were a way to reliably reproduce the problem
Nov 17 18:58:33 .:ayecee:.	doesn't sound like that's the case here though.
Nov 17 18:58:44 .:Successus:.	do you think the same string would reproduce this bug?
Nov 17 18:59:13 .:ayecee:.	i'd have no idea.
Nov 17 18:59:21 .:ayecee:.	something to try though.
Nov 17 19:00:37 .:Successus:.	alright so parcellite is not running. I am pressing ^b (I set it to b and not v) in st to paste but it is not working.
Nov 17 19:00:47 .:Successus:.	now I could run xsel -o?
Nov 17 19:01:13 .:Successus:.	Error: target STRING not available
Nov 17 19:01:13 .:ayecee:.	i don't have these commands memorized, sorry. what does xsel -o do?
Nov 17 19:01:19 .:Successus:.	it should paste
Nov 17 19:01:28 .:Successus:.	xclip and xsel are 'clients' of the clipboard
Nov 17 19:01:44 .:Successus:.	you can add strings to clipboard, append to strings, paste them
Nov 17 19:01:52 .:rascul:.	is there any more or is that the only output of xsel?
Nov 17 19:01:52 .:ayecee:.	does it paste that error message, or just display it?
Nov 17 19:01:54 .:Successus:.	so it's not pasting
Nov 17 19:01:57 .:Successus:.	nothing in xsel
Nov 17 19:02:03 .:Successus:.	it displays it
Nov 17 19:02:11 .:Successus:.	see, xsel pastes nothing
Nov 17 19:02:16 .:Successus:.	xclip writes that error message
Nov 17 19:02:23 .:Successus:.	so paste is not working, as I described
Nov 17 19:02:47 .:ayecee:.	i don't follow. does xclip display that message, or does xsel display it?
Nov 17 19:02:55 .:Successus:.	xclip displays it
Nov 17 19:03:26 .:rascul:.	i see something that implies that happens when you get binary data copied
Nov 17 19:03:34 .:ayecee:.	okay, and xsel simply pastes nothing, got it.
Nov 17 19:03:42 .:Successus:.	yes but it's text that I copied
Nov 17 19:03:47 .:Successus:.	and I eventually can paste it
Nov 17 19:03:57 .:Successus:.	just that it fails for some time
Nov 17 19:03:58 .:rascul:.	you think it's text
Nov 17 19:04:06 .:Successus:.	ok but then I paste it
Nov 17 19:04:11 .:ayecee:.	how long does it take before you can paste it?
Nov 17 19:04:14 .:rascul:.	paste it where?
Nov 17 19:04:16 .:Successus:.	some time
Nov 17 19:04:18 .:Successus:.	in terminal
Nov 17 19:04:19 .:Successus:.	st
Nov 17 19:04:21 .:rascul:.	and it works?
Nov 17 19:04:24 .:Successus:.	yes
Nov 17 19:04:27 .:ayecee:.	some time as in a second, a minute, and hour, what?
Nov 17 19:04:32 .:rascul:.	when doesn't it work?
Nov 17 19:04:32 .:Successus:.	minute
Nov 17 19:04:36 .:Successus:.	some seconds
Nov 17 19:04:47 .:Successus:.	it doesn't work immediately after copying
Nov 17 19:04:53 .:Successus:.	it takes some seconds to be pasted
Nov 17 19:04:53 .:ayecee:.	5 seconds, 15, 45?
Nov 17 19:04:57 .:rascul:.	but it works if you wait a minute?
Nov 17 19:05:03 .:chiselfuse:.	ayecee: i think it's this     https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/18883
Nov 17 19:05:04 .:Successus:.	right about 15
Nov 17 19:05:17 .:Successus:.	if I paste with xclip it gives that error
Nov 17 19:05:21 .:ayecee:.	could it be the copy that's slow?
Nov 17 19:05:27 .:Successus:.	no
Nov 17 19:05:30 .:Successus:.	it gives error
Nov 17 19:05:32 .:Successus:.	and doesn't paste
Nov 17 19:05:38 .:rascul:.	is the window you copied from still open?
Nov 17 19:05:47 .:Successus:.	yes it is
Nov 17 19:05:51 .:Successus:.	when I am pasting
Nov 17 19:05:54 .:Successus:.	it is still open
Nov 17 19:05:59 .:ayecee:.	Successus: i mean, what shows that it's on the clipboard?
Nov 17 19:06:20 .:Successus:.	if I open Parcellite's list it is shown
Nov 17 19:06:22 .:Successus:.	that it is copied
Nov 17 19:06:29 .:ayecee:.	i see
Nov 17 19:07:22 .:rascul:.	try using the verbose option with xclip or xsel or whatever
Nov 17 19:07:28 .:rascul:.	maybe it'll show something useful
Nov 17 19:08:10 .:Successus:.	xsel: Conversion refused
Nov 17 19:08:25 .:Successus:.	xclip pastes nothing useful with --verbose
Nov 17 19:08:37 .:Successus:.	Connected to X server. Using UTF8_STRING. Error: target STRING not available
Nov 17 19:08:53 .:rascul:.	probably best to consult the man pages for the actual options
Nov 17 19:09:01 .:rascul:.	and you wouldn't use the verbose option on its own
Nov 17 19:09:08 .:Successus:.	I use -o to paste
Nov 17 19:09:13 .:rascul:.	you copied it from a browser?
Nov 17 19:09:16 .:Successus:.	yes
Nov 17 19:09:26 .:rascul:.	can you view the raw html for the part you copied?
Nov 17 19:09:38 .:Successus:.	I guess if I knew what string it was
Nov 17 19:09:42 .:rascul:.	i kinda wonder if you inadvertently copied an image in addition to text
Nov 17 19:09:50 .:Successus:.	but I am able to paste eventually, always
Nov 17 19:09:51 .:chronos3:.	guys, I have no audio output on my laptop running arch. When I open pavucontrol, the output device is listed as "dummy device". Can someone assist me in solving this?
Nov 17 19:11:10 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: has audio output worked before on this laptop while running arch?
Nov 17 19:11:19 .:ayecee:.	Successus: that's a weird problem alright.
Nov 17 19:11:40 .:Successus:.	yes it is
Nov 17 19:11:54 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, yeah it did. Im on the mainline kernel though
Nov 17 19:12:22 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: when did audio stop working?
Nov 17 19:12:43 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, it mighht be after I switched to mainline. but I dont exactly remember
Nov 17 19:12:57 .:rascul:.	where did the mainline kernel config come from?
Nov 17 19:13:11 .:chronos3:.	yay -S linux-mainline
Nov 17 19:13:19 .:chronos3:.	its the repos
Nov 17 19:13:22 .:chronos3:.	in the
Nov 17 19:13:26 .:rascul:.	oh
Nov 17 19:13:26 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: was that recent? an hour, a day, a week?
Nov 17 19:13:33 .:chronos3:.	a day
Nov 17 19:13:38 .:rascul:.	you didn't build it? i had made that assumption
Nov 17 19:14:00 .:chronos3:.	no i didnt build it. it is available on the AUR
Nov 17 19:14:00 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: have you rebooted since first discovering the problem?
Nov 17 19:14:07 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, yup
Nov 17 19:14:29 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: do you have a way to switch back to what you were using before the switch, to see if that's the cause?
Nov 17 19:15:16 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, i can delete the mainline kernel and switch to stable version. But my laptop keyboard doesnt work on the stable kernel
Nov 17 19:15:46 .:rascul:.	maybe just use a distro that works out of the box?
Nov 17 19:16:05 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: okay. could be an option to test later, if nothing easier comes up.
Nov 17 19:16:38 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: my gut feeling would be that the sound device hasn't been detected, or hasn't initialized. do you have a way to check if it's working, or, could you pastebin dmesg output?
Nov 17 19:16:54 .:chronos3:.	rascul, its not a distro problem. Its a kernel problem. The 6.0.1 kernel doesnt have drivers for my laptop keyboard, only the mainline kernal has it
Nov 17 19:17:35 .:chronos3:.	`https://paste.rs/Nyz
Nov 17 19:17:42 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, this is the output
Nov 17 19:19:04 .:ayecee:.	do you know which device should be your audio output?
Nov 17 19:19:50 .:chronos3:.	no
Nov 17 19:19:55 .:chronos3:.	its my laptop speaker
Nov 17 19:20:44 .:ayecee:.	huh. i guess pavucontrol would just show pulseaudio devices. let's see if alsa has detected anything. "aplay -l" might do that.
Nov 17 19:21:13 .:chronos3:.	https://paste.rs/IDO
Nov 17 19:21:15 .:chronos3:.	here is the output
Nov 17 19:22:37 .:ayecee:.	huh. that's all through the display driver.
Nov 17 19:23:12 .:ayecee:.	anything from "lspci | grep -i audio" ?
Nov 17 19:23:42 .:chronos3:.	0000:00:1f.3 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation Alder Lake PCH-P High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)
Nov 17 19:23:46 .:chronos3:.	yes
Nov 17 19:24:01 .:chronos3:.	it is detecting an audio output device
Nov 17 19:24:25 .:ayecee:.	yup. guess that would be the HDA Analog output
Nov 17 19:24:40 .:ayecee:.	but pavucontrol doesn't provide that as an output option
Nov 17 19:24:50 .:ayecee:.	if i undersetand correctly
Nov 17 19:25:06 .:chronos3:.	so should I install another audiomixer?
Nov 17 19:25:27 .:chronos3:.	like kmix
Nov 17 19:25:29 .:rascul:.	pactl list sinks
Nov 17 19:25:33 .:ayecee:.	seems a bit premature for a jump like that
Nov 17 19:25:46 .:chronos3:.	hmm
Nov 17 19:25:54 .:chronos3:.	so what should be my next step?
Nov 17 19:25:59 .:ayecee:.	sure, look at it a different way, with pactl list sinks
Nov 17 19:26:24 .:rascul:.	oh i missed the aplay output
Nov 17 19:26:38 .:chronos3:.	https://paste.rs/pJt
Nov 17 19:26:39 .:rascul:.	pactl i don't think will give any more useful info at this time
Nov 17 19:27:06 .:chronos3:.	this is th eoutput of pactl
Nov 17 19:27:09 .:chronos3:.	the*
Nov 17 19:27:21 .:ayecee:.	huh. so alsa shows the devices, but pa doesn't have them.
Nov 17 19:27:46 .:rascul:.	the audio device seems to be a realtek ALC294 i think
Nov 17 19:28:38 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, hmm. that is weird
Nov 17 19:29:21 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: shot in the dark, if you run "groups", do you see pulse in the list?
Nov 17 19:29:37 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, nope
Nov 17 19:29:42 .:chronos3:.	only wheel
Nov 17 19:30:00 .:ayecee:.	are you doing this as root or something?
Nov 17 19:30:15 .:chronos3:.	no
Nov 17 19:30:18 .:chronos3:.	im a regular user
Nov 17 19:30:34 .:ayecee:.	does "grep pulse /etc/group" return anything?
Nov 17 19:30:57 .:chronos3:.	nope it doesnt
Nov 17 19:31:00 .:rascul:.	try running 'aplay -l' as root, see if you get something different
Nov 17 19:31:41 .:chronos3:.	https://paste.rs/M8E
Nov 17 19:31:44 .:chronos3:.	no its the same output

Nov 17 19:31:47 .:chronos3:.	https://paste.rs/M8E
Nov 17 19:31:53 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: got anything in /dev/snd? if so, what's the group on those files?
Nov 17 19:31:56 .:chronos3:.	oh sorry, i didnt mean to paste it twice

Nov 17 19:33:38 .:ayecee:.	okay, how about ls -l /dev/controlC0 ?
Nov 17 19:33:53 .:ayecee:.	looks like your distro is putting these in different places from mine.

Nov 17 19:39:46 .:chronos3:.	yeah
Nov 17 19:39:52 .:ayecee:.	huh. how come it only shows one owner field? mine shows a user owner and a group owner
Nov 17 19:40:05 .:chronos3:.	crw-rw----+ 1 root audio 116, 12 Nov 17 20:33 controlC0
Nov 17 19:40:12 .:ayecee:.	ok.
Nov 17 19:40:24 .:chronos3:.	because i did ls -lg
Nov 17 19:40:25 .:umbramalison:.	Hi, i'm trying to boot a kernel with a built-in initramfs (rootfs), with this init script (https://controlc.com/b4967361), intending to switch_root to an overlayfs that is backed by the rootfs and a RW drive. This process works if I don't link the initramfs into the kernel. but when linked in, the newroot is empty
Nov 17 19:40:25 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: add yourself to the audio group, log out, log in, and see if your audio works.
Nov 17 19:40:37 .:ayecee:.	would be my guess on resolving that.
Nov 17 19:40:39 .:chronos3:.	ok give me a second
Nov 17 19:40:55 .:rascul:.	'aplay -l' didn't list anything new as root so i'm not hopeful the audio group matters right now
Nov 17 19:41:27 .:ayecee:.	still, i don't see how pa would use that without it.
Nov 17 19:42:07 .:rascul:.	does intel use realtek audio chips?
Nov 17 19:42:39 .:umbramalison:.	obviously I'd much rather link the initramfs into the kernel... what am I missing? almost everything I've read that talks explicitly about rootfs is written interms of switching to a different root entirely. rather than retaining the contents, like I would like to.
Nov 17 19:42:58 .:rascul:.	i see some realtek audio related stuff in the linked dmesg:    [    8.374261] snd_hda_codec_realtek ehdaudio0D0: autoconfig for ALC294: line_outs=1 (0x14/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0) type:speaker
Nov 17 19:44:05 .:ayecee:.	i don't know what that chip does in particular.
Nov 17 19:44:19 .:Successus:.	it can't be that I copied an image because I would experience this error sometime during the last few years
Nov 17 19:44:50 .:Successus:.	I searched for 'xsel: conversion refused' but the results weren't useful
Nov 17 19:44:55 .:ayecee:.	Successus: it can be if the page you're copying from has changed.
Nov 17 19:45:20 .:Successus:.	what I mean is that I would probably at least once have copied an image, during the last few years
Nov 17 19:45:32 .:ayecee:.	you'd think so, but let's not rule it out by that logic.
Nov 17 19:46:00 .:rascul:.	i've copied images, i've never (that i can recall) tried to paste an image into an area that only accepts text
Nov 17 19:46:20 .:Successus:.	so what do you do, you select both image and text?
Nov 17 19:46:36 .:Successus:.	it's not giving me trouble now
Nov 17 19:47:05 .:Successus:.	I select both image and text, if the image has an alt attribute then that description is copied, otherwise it's just an empty line for the image
Nov 17 19:47:37 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, still no output.
Nov 17 19:47:54 .:chronos3:.	I also added my user to optical, video and storage as well
Nov 17 19:48:02 .:ayecee:.	chronos3: "groups" now shows audio, yes?
Nov 17 19:48:10 .:chronos3:.	and now youtube videos arent playing anymore
Nov 17 19:48:14 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, yes it does
Nov 17 19:48:21 .:ayecee:.	huh.
Nov 17 19:48:52 .:ayecee:.	pactl list sinks, still shows only dummy?
Nov 17 19:49:36 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, i mean, pactl list sinks is not even outputting anything rn
Nov 17 19:49:46 .:chronos3:.	it says "connection failire: tiimeout"
Nov 17 19:49:52 .:ayecee:.	well that's new
Nov 17 19:50:22 .:ayecee:.	i don't know why it would be required, but maybe a reboot would get things back to a known state.
Nov 17 19:50:39 .:ayecee:.	we can try to find a way to start pa manually but this is probably easier.
Nov 17 19:50:40 .:chronos3:.	I've already rebooted twice
Nov 17 19:50:53 .:ayecee:.	great, then you've got lots of practice for this time
Nov 17 19:51:10 .:ayecee:.	oh, rebooted after changing the groups?
Nov 17 19:51:20 .:chronos3:.	I'm just gonna install ubuntu and switch to the mainline kernel there
Nov 17 19:51:23 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, yup
Nov 17 19:51:43 .:ayecee:.	i see. i guess at this point you would have to run pa manually to see why it wasn't starting.
Nov 17 19:51:53 .:ayecee:.	or install ubuntu, also works.
Nov 17 19:52:03 .:chronos3:.	run pa mannually?
Nov 17 19:52:51 .:ayecee:.	try running "pulseaudio --start", see what it says.
Nov 17 19:53:17 .:chronos3:.	i dont have pulseaudio
Nov 17 19:53:20 .:chronos3:.	i have pipewire
Nov 17 19:53:30 .:ayecee:.	then why are you using pavucontrol that controls pulseaudio
Nov 17 19:54:00 .:chronos3:.	because someone from arch linux irc told me to install it and test it there
Nov 17 19:54:13 .:ayecee:.	okay well there's problem 0.
Nov 17 19:54:16 .:chronos3:.	also it is connected to pipewire-pulse, i think
Nov 17 19:54:45 .:ayecee:.	find out how to list pipewire sinks.
Nov 17 19:55:45 .:chronos3:.	ayecee, it uses pactl list sinks as well
Nov 17 19:55:55 .:ayecee:.	no it doesn't. pactl is for pulseaudio.
Nov 17 19:56:13 .:n9vt:.	why changing external host in epik.com for domain does not redirect to it
Nov 17 19:56:29 .:chronos3:.	pactl is also for pipewire-pulse

Nov 17 22:19:07 .:davidsong:.	are there any encrypted filesystems that I can run on a potentially hostile system and only reveal keys for a specific tree or subtree on request?
Nov 17 22:20:54 .:ayecee:.	not as such, no.
Nov 17 22:23:51 .:ayecee:.	if you're using the potentially hostile system as file storage, ecryptfs would allow you to store only encrypted files while transparently decrypting data on the local system when it's mounted.
Nov 17 22:24:20 .:hodapp:.	'potentially hostile' might need a better definition to say much else
Nov 17 22:24:53 .:umop3plsdn:.	#archlinux
Nov 17 22:25:02 .:ayecee:.	however that wouldn't allow you to use those encrypted files on the potentially hostile system.
Nov 17 22:26:10 .:davidsong:.	the system I'm thinking about: you have a p2p hosted data layer, ipfs, and you have your favourite pet operating system that starts as a docker container (there's lots of images to start from, lots of options for users). you go to some machine, log on using a crypto-wallet type thing to release the keys to the OS files and minimal parts of your
Nov 17 22:26:11 .:davidsong:.	homedir
Nov 17 22:27:34 .:ayecee:.	security models don't often include a provision for only sometimes revealing passwords to hostile agents.
Nov 17 22:27:38 .:davidsong:.	use peer.js from your phone to authorize (sign) pushing data back into the data layer. the more you trust the host, the more areas you can unlock
Nov 17 22:28:45 .:ayecee:.	once the hostile agent has the password, there's not a way to undo that.
Nov 17 22:29:43 .:davidsong:.	well in the general case the hosts are friendly, but occasionally one might not be - so limiting your surface area is preferable to giving everyone all the data. not giving every place that you log on to, or a place that is just part of your distributed backup and you spun it up to have a look at it, is wiser than unlocking everything and trusting
Nov 17 22:29:44 .:davidsong:.	the sysadmin completely
Nov 17 22:30:41 .:davidsong:.	plus I might have work documents in there that I don't want on my gf's machine, or dick pics that I don't want decrypted on my work machine except in an emergency
Nov 17 22:31:06 .:ayecee:.	what an emergency that would be eh
Nov 17 22:31:14 .:davidsong:.	really hot new head of HR?
Nov 17 22:31:20 .:ayecee:.	what could go wrong
Nov 17 22:31:48 .:Thuryn:.	my last HR director described it as "adult babysitting"
Nov 17 22:31:54 .:ayecee:.	what happens if you try to access these files when they're not unlocked?
Nov 17 22:32:01 .:davidsong:.	IOERROR
Nov 17 22:32:13 .:ayecee:.	you can see the filenames though?
Nov 17 22:32:36 .:davidsong:.	depends I guess, if you're in the dir up then you can see the dir object if that's decrypted I guess
Nov 17 22:32:50 .:davidsong:.	but only the filenames if the directory entry is decrypted
Nov 17 22:33:09 .:ayecee:.	sounds like this could be accomplished with ecryptfs then.
Nov 17 22:33:36 .:ayecee:.	it will act as a layer on top of whatever filesystem you're storing files in.
Nov 17 22:33:59 .:davidsong:.	oh so you can add more layers of it to the base layer?
Nov 17 22:34:10 .:ayecee:.	sure
Nov 17 22:34:27 .:davidsong:.	cool, that'd work
Nov 17 22:34:36 .:ayecee:.	you could also use encrypted subvolumes on btrfs
Nov 17 22:34:46 .:davidsong:.	yeah but btrfs though
Nov 17 22:34:55 .:ayecee:.	come on man
Nov 17 22:34:59 .:davidsong:.	it ate my data
Nov 17 22:35:26 .:ayecee:.	if you're just going to shoot stuff down it's really hard to want to suggest more.
Nov 17 22:35:39 .:davidsong:.	aw sorry I didn't mean to be a dick
Nov 17 22:35:49 .:davidsong:.	I do appreciate your help
Nov 17 22:35:51 .:ayecee:.	zfs probably has encrypted subvolumes too
Nov 17 22:36:36 .:ayecee:.	so not really encrypted directories but it does the job if you can mount things.
Nov 17 22:36:43 .:davidsong:.	i was using it to dedupe 60TB of books from a bunch of different pirate libraries because whole file deduping is better than zfs chunks, I was in IO hell for about 18 months and no backup because the data is too big
Nov 17 22:37:13 .:ayecee:.	lesson learned i guess.
Nov 17 22:37:30 .:hodapp:.	wow, I never knew there were that many books on pirates
Nov 17 22:37:30 .:davidsong:.	btrfs that is. had wifi card that went bananas and leaked packets into the metadata during a reorg
Nov 17 22:37:51 .:ayecee:.	zfs's dedupe is online and requires a lot of memory.
Nov 17 22:37:59 .:ayecee:.	btrfs dedupe is offline.
Nov 17 22:38:18 .:davidsong:.	yeah it's block level. btrfs is whole files so can do megs at a time
Nov 17 22:38:26 .:hodapp:.	btrfs also has reflinks, for whatever ad-hoc dedupe you want to do that way
Nov 17 22:38:38 .:hodapp:.	(so does XFS for that matter)
Nov 17 22:39:14 .:davidsong:.	yeah I was using some tool that just did that sort of thing in the background I think, went through and deduped by checking the hashes of uh.. generations? dunno what they're called, revisions or tree nodes or whatever
Nov 17 22:39:26 .:davidsong:.	it walked the entire tree. was doing pretty well at it too, saved about 20gb
Nov 17 22:39:38 .:ayecee:.	20gb on 60tb eh XD
Nov 17 22:39:44 .:davidsong:.	tb sorry
Nov 17 22:39:45 .:davidsong:.	lol
Nov 17 22:39:52 .:ayecee:.	that soundsd better.
Nov 17 22:40:30 .:davidsong:.	i had every virus that libgen had ever published!
Nov 17 22:40:35 .:davidsong:.	:D
Nov 17 22:41:08 .:ayecee:.	in the dictionary, next to packrat, there's a picture of davidsong
Nov 17 22:41:18 .:davidsong:.	gone now though. lesson learned: use different kernels or a single use box - do not trust your drivers in a monolithic kernel
Nov 17 22:42:17 .:davidsong:.	and don't stack btrfs on top of mdadm even if btrfs raid is broken, at least the underneath isn't shifting around uncontrollably
Nov 17 22:43:23 .:davidsong:.	back to the topic, I think I'd like to do as much as possible in userspace so it's actually installable as a general use program. maybe something that can integrate with the logon manager
Nov 17 22:43:43 .:davidsong:.	so FUSE is probably ideal?
Nov 17 22:44:18 .:ayecee:.	is it?
Nov 17 22:44:40 .:davidsong:.	I know performance isn't great, but it seems more controllable than having to rely on kernel mods
Nov 17 22:44:53 .:ayecee:.	you'll need the ability to mount and unmount things in any case.
Nov 17 22:44:56 .:davidsong:.	but I dunno, not really my wheelhouse
Nov 17 22:45:30 .:davidsong:.	yeah I was thinking a deamon that does mount/unmount and start/stop containers
Nov 17 22:46:06 .:davidsong:.	not sure about how to do ioerrors for encrypted files N layers deep though?
Nov 17 22:46:29 .:davidsong:.	*in my wheelhouse

Nov 17 22:46:39 .:desunator:.	i have a system on which disk space is being periodically filled up and there are disk space error messages in syslog, but when i log into it whatever was filling up the disk is gone, as i understand some process creates a big file and then fills up disk fails and file gets deleted, there is nothing helpful in logs. how can i go about catching the
Nov 17 22:46:40 .:desunator:.	process which is doing this?
Nov 17 22:49:25 .:ayecee:.	davidsong: they simply wouldn't appear until the filesystem was mounted.
Nov 17 22:49:41 .:Thuryn:.	desunator, which part of the filesystem is getting filled?
Nov 17 22:50:06 .:Sircle:.	Hi
Nov 17 22:50:51 .:Sircle:.	It seems I cannot use more than 50% of cpu and more than 70% or memory to be utilized by guest os in virtualbox. But I wanted to run guest os for the most part. Do I have any other options?
Nov 17 22:51:09 .:ayecee:.	what happens when you try
Nov 17 22:51:26 .:desunator:.	Thuryn system has just one partition everything is under /
Nov 17 22:51:46 .:davidsong:.	ayecee it doesn't have that ... uh.. can't remember what they are, but a dir full of weird named files?
Nov 17 22:51:50 .:Thuryn:.	desunator, yes but it doesn't just "fill up."  There are files someplace.
Nov 17 22:52:14 .:davidsong:.	or am I thinking of some older encrypted filesystem technology
Nov 17 22:52:17 .:ayecee:.	davidsong: ecryptfs would. there would be no ioerror for those i guess.
Nov 17 22:52:33 .:davidsong:.	would it shorten the maximum filename with each layer?
Nov 17 22:52:45 .:ayecee:.	would it?
Nov 17 22:52:57 .:desunator:.	because each time i try to check disk space it's there i only assume whatever fills the disk deletes its stuff after write failure due to lack of disk space
Nov 17 22:53:04 .:desunator:.	so i don't really know
Nov 17 22:53:14 .:davidsong:.	I thought it's 160 characters rather than 255 on encrypted filesystems on Ubuntu. can't remember what it uses though
Nov 17 22:53:21 .:desunator:.	only trace of this happening is errors in logs
Nov 17 22:53:26 .:Sircle:.	ayecee  ayecee this https://imgur.com/CG08irA.png
Nov 17 22:53:29 .:ayecee:.	davidsong: would probably have to check.
Nov 17 22:53:46 .:davidsong:.	desunator that's an interesting problem. I mean, not good, but interesting
Nov 17 22:53:52 .:ayecee:.	davidsong: i feel like that might be a limit for unix socket names.
Nov 17 22:53:56 .:desunator:.	yeah i agree totally
Nov 17 22:54:11 .:Thuryn:.	desunator, do you have another linux box around someplace?
Nov 17 22:54:25 .:ayecee:.	Sircle: what happens if you hit ok
Nov 17 22:54:25 .:davidsong:.	ayecee cool I'll check
Nov 17 22:54:30 .:desunator:.	yea
Nov 17 22:54:37 .:davidsong:.	desunator: how often is it happening, and how critical is performance on the machine?
Nov 17 22:54:53 .:desunator:.	it runs some stuff so i can't bog it down
Nov 17 22:55:01 .:Sircle:.	ayecee nothing unusual https://imgur.com/jAFyALm.png
Nov 17 22:55:16 .:Thuryn:.	desunator, set up logging so that syslog gets relayed to the other Linux box.
Nov 17 22:55:47 .:Thuryn:.	desunator, then you can set up whatever monitors you want on the "problem" system and have it report what it finds to syslog, which will get sent to the secondary box (which should still have disk space during the trouble)
Nov 17 22:56:15 .:desunator:.	i was thinking more along the lines of start screen
Nov 17 22:56:35 .:desunator:.	and run something there but just du -h won't really be helpful
Nov 17 22:57:01 .:desunator:.	somehow best way i suppose would be to get names of all processes that fail
Nov 17 22:57:17 .:desunator:.	which way you suggested would work for
Nov 17 22:57:33 .:Thuryn:.	you need something more like "du -sh /*" and "ps -aefwww" at intervals
Nov 17 22:57:52 .:Thuryn:.	the "du" bit is kinda painful, but it would help to know WHERE it's writing to
Nov 17 22:58:09 .:desunator:.	well actually yeah makes sense, like report space for each directory each several seconds
Nov 17 22:58:15 .:desunator:.	might work
Nov 17 22:58:42 .:Thuryn:.	if it takes too long, you could try something like this:  du -sh /home /var /tmp
Nov 17 22:59:00 .:Thuryn:.	since a lot of the other spaces aren't typically non-root writable
Nov 17 22:59:06 .:davidsong:.	actually... your free space will be filled up with whatever it's writing
Nov 17 22:59:07 .:Thuryn:.	maybe throw in /root
Nov 17 22:59:18 .:davidsong:.	can you have a peek at it?
Nov 17 22:59:26 .:davidsong:.	testdisk
Nov 17 22:59:29 .:desunator:.	hmm
Nov 17 22:59:51 .:desunator:.	yeah i can try but now i'm thinking
Nov 17 23:00:04 .:desunator:.	is there a way to like log all files open for writing
Nov 17 23:00:16 .:desunator:.	would probably be optimal
Nov 17 23:00:17 .:davidsong:.	yeah you can use inotify but you won't have a good time
Nov 17 23:00:21 .:desunator:.	oh
Nov 17 23:00:31 .:desunator:.	yeah i suppose that's right
Nov 17 23:00:53 .:davidsong:.	I'd stick testdisk on the thing and have a browse round for large red files in /var/ and /tmp
Nov 17 23:00:54 .:Thuryn:.	i don't know how well inotify output can be tuned to rule out the "steady state" stuff that you don't care about.
Nov 17 23:01:45 .:Thuryn:.	you could also make /tmp into a loopback filesystem to limit its scope and see if that's it.
Nov 17 23:01:50 .:Thuryn:.	same for /home
Nov 17 23:02:35 .:Thuryn:.	doing that with /tmp/ would also allow you to put some limits like 'noexec' on it.
Nov 17 23:03:00 .:ayecee:.	Sircle: seems like it's just a warning then. you can be as reckless with this as you want.
Nov 17 23:07:45 .:Sircle:.	ayecee ok
Nov 17 23:19:44 .:davidsong:.	hrm might be off-topic but still thinking about my os idea. is there a structure like a merkel tree that can prove a small part of a big file has the right sha256 hash without transfering the whole file?
Nov 17 23:20:30 .:ayecee:.	how about a merkel tree
Nov 17 23:20:40 .:davidsong:.	like, i want to sign permission for the host to publish a specific 10gb file to ipfs using my phone, but I don't want to hash it myself
Nov 17 23:21:42 .:davidsong:.	oh.. yes of course, the files are broken into chunks anyway I think, so you can take the hash of the hashes and challenge/response any number of segments
Nov 17 23:23:32 .:peetaur:.	davidsong: the rdiff command makes a big file of sums that can do that basically ....but the command wants to use the sums on the whole file after
Nov 17 23:24:17 .:davidsong:.	peetaur: yeah the problem is that I don't get to decide the hashing algorithm. I might get to decide the chunk size though, I'm not sure
Nov 17 23:24:46 .:peetaur:.	maybe the source code just needs a s/whatever/sha256/g
Nov 17 23:25:17 .:peetaur:.	I guess since rdiff just uses librsync that's where the source is
Nov 17 23:25:43 .:davidsong:.	so I sign "the hashes of these files replace my files across the p2p network" and it happens, but I don't wanna sign that blind, and I don't want to transfer gigs of data back to my phone
Nov 17 23:26:15 .:davidsong:.	because the device getting the signature from me might be lying about the hashes

Nov 18 12:09:21 .:woland:.	mncheck: roxterm colorscheme
Nov 18 12:15:53 <mncheck>	woland, without knowing roxterm I think they are a 24-bit color with alpha channel, 4*24=96-bit
Nov 18 12:16:07 .:mncheck:.	(each pair of digits is 8 bit)
Nov 18 12:11:24 .:woland:.	so its like RRRR-GGGG-BBBB ?
Nov 18 12:16:56 .:mncheck:.	wow I just made some weird math mistake
Nov 18 12:18:13 <mncheck>	woland, it would be rrrgggbbbaaa where a is for alpha, but don't quote me on the ordering
Nov 18 12:18:37 .:mncheck:.	it may also not be rgb but yuv or cmyk though that is unlikely here
Nov 18 12:13:31 .:woland:.	jesus why cant they just use css
Nov 18 12:19:16 <mncheck>	woland, it looks like it is on purpose
Nov 18 12:14:20 .:woland:.	yup

Nov 18 12:32:05 .:lv426res:.	not that it matters anymore, but #rrrrggggbbbb is RGB 16-bits per channel.

Nov 18 12:32:31 .:mncheck:.	lv426res, math is fuzzy today
Nov 18 12:33:40 <mncheck>	woland, I think the colors go to this function https://docs.gtk.org/gdk3/method.RGBA.parse.html

Nov 18 13:48:17 .:colo:.	I have a USB 3.1 device connected to a USB 3.1 Host Controller on a VMware ESXi host. A Debian 11 VM has a VMware 3.1 XHCI-conforming controller set up. when I pass the USB device (which can do 10Gbps when connected to bare metal running Debian 11) into the VM, it always gets set up on a 480Mbps port on the emulated hub. how can I find out why that happens? result: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1261080
Nov 18 13:49:00 .:simplicius:.	Hello
Nov 18 13:49:02 .:simplicius:.	If the area of a circle increases by 44% what's the increase in the perimeter?
Nov 18 13:49:20 .:djph:.	colo: so you VM can't do 3.1 ?
Nov 18 13:49:28 .:hexnewbie:.	simplicius: 2 armed soldiers
Nov 18 13:49:37 .:djph:.	colo: is 3.1 even available to VMware?
Nov 18 13:49:41 .:mlu:.	simplicius: I don't know
Nov 18 13:50:01 .:colo:.	djph: yes, it is available. it works on Windows hosts, and is documented to work with Linux 4.6 and up.
Nov 18 13:50:03 .:mlu:.	simplicius: um, actually try a math channel or something :P
Nov 18 13:50:21 .:hexnewbie:.	colo: It *could* be a VMWare issue. Not saying that it *is*, but failing to rule that out, it would be difficult to propose any Linux solution
Nov 18 13:50:39 .:hexnewbie:.	or troubleshooting avenue
Nov 18 13:50:50 .:djph:.	colo: then I suppose the first thing to do is find out how to shove a device onto vmware's USB 3 hub
Nov 18 13:51:14 .:mlu:.	simplicius: hint: what is the formula for the area of a circle? what about the formula for the perimeter of a circle? can you solve for `r`?
Nov 18 13:51:14 .:colo:.	hexnewbie: yeah, I am aware of that :) but everything seems fine on the ESX side of things... I was wondering if I could get more info out of the xhci driver as to how the bus speed is negotiated.
Nov 18 13:51:55 .:colo:.	djph: it is already attached there (also made sure by the fact that I removed all emulated USB 2.0 controllers)
Nov 18 13:52:54 .:djph:.	and yet, you're only getting USB2.0 ... perhaps an artifact of handoff between vmware and the metal (I dunno)

Nov 18 14:02:00 .:colo:.	lv426res: yeah, it's worked at 10Gbps with that exact same cable :)
Nov 18 14:02:32 .:colo:.	I just checked, and another USB3.1 device exhibits the very same problem
Nov 18 14:06:30 .:ne2k:.	riya: are you suggesting that it's wrong to refer to the length of the edge of a circle as its perimeter?
Nov 18 14:07:28 .:riya:.	simplicius: 20%
Nov 18 14:07:46 .:riya:.	no, i didn't say that, ne2k
Nov 18 14:07:46 .:ne2k:.	colo: can you pass the whole USB controller through to the guest at the PCI level? that was the only way I could get USB 3.0 speeds in qemu when I tried it a number of years ago
Nov 18 14:08:46 .:simplicius:.	riya: exactly that or close something like 22.2%?
Nov 18 14:10:00 .:ne2k:.	simplicius: we're not going to do your maths homework for you. if you write up your attempt a solution you might get someone to look at it and suggest whether its correct or not, and if not, what you might like to revisit to improve it
Nov 18 14:10:10 .:colo:.	ne2k: no, I used the "USB Host Device" forwarding we use on vmware with other guest OS
Nov 18 14:10:13 .:riya:.	exactly
Nov 18 14:10:35 .:ne2k:.	colo: no, I'm not asking whether you did, I'm asking whether you can try it
Nov 18 14:11:18 .:ne2k:.	colo are you able to get usb 3.1 speeds with the same forwarding on other guest OSes?
Nov 18 14:11:36 .:colo:.	ne2k: not possible, as this will probably wreak havoc on the other guests on the host
Nov 18 14:11:57 .:colo:.	ne2k: yes, 10Gbps is possible using this configuration in a Windows 10 guest on the same cluster and host
Nov 18 14:12:24 .:ne2k:.	colo have you installed the hypervisor's recommended drivers in the guests in both cases?
Nov 18 14:12:52 .:colo:.	there are none. vmware emulates an xHCI-conforming device, for which there are only generic drivers.
Nov 18 14:13:40 .:ne2k:.	colo tried any different flavours of linux in the guest or different kernels?
Nov 18 14:14:57 .:ne2k:.	colo, dmesg |grep xhci show anything interesting?
Nov 18 14:15:41 .:colo:.	ne2k: not tried other distros yet, no. and there's nothing out of the ordinary in `dmesg` when the devices get attached.
Nov 18 14:16:03 .:ne2k:.	colo specifically the first mention when the xhci_hcd module is loaded, what speed does it say it supports?
Nov 18 14:16:13 .:colo:.	and `lspci -vvv` shows the device's descriptors advertising both SuperSpeed and 10Gbps speeds
Nov 18 14:17:04 .:colo:.	I can see that the first bus/hub emulated advertises 10Gbps being supported:  /:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 10000M
Nov 18 14:17:28 .:ne2k:.	colo what is the kernel version?
Nov 18 14:17:32 .:colo:.	upon loading, the hci driver reports [    1.148565] xhci_hcd 0000:13:00.0: Host supports USB 3.1 Enhanced SuperSpeed
Nov 18 14:17:43 .:colo:.	Debian 11 with latest 5.10 kernel image from main
Nov 18 14:18:13 .:ne2k:.	colo I'm no expert in this area but if it were me, I'd try something bleeding edge like arch just to rule out the kernel
Nov 18 14:19:13 .:ne2k:.	colo other things I might think of would be – if you go back to win does it still work or has something got screwed in the host? does a host reboot change anything?
Nov 18 14:19:17 .:lv426res:.	colo: interesting problem. check /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf   look at the documentation for SetStorageDelay
Nov 18 14:19:33 .:ne2k:.	(but I guess that's hard as you've said you have other guests that you don't want to screw)
Nov 18 14:19:35 .:lv426res:.	maybe increasing the delay will help
Nov 18 14:20:02 .:colo:.	lv426res: the disks are already spun up by vmware when connecting them, fwiw
Nov 18 14:20:19 .:colo:.	the VM does not even have usb modeswitch installed apparently :)
Nov 18 14:20:35 .:colo:.	ne2k: I will re-check in a windows guest
Nov 18 14:20:38 »»	colo sighs
Nov 18 14:20:43 .:shadow0x:.	hi
Nov 18 14:20:50 .:ne2k:.	I was going to wonder whether this was a modeswitchy device and whether that modeswitch thing was likely to do anythign if it weren't
Nov 18 14:20:56 .:colo:.	if this fails, I will have to look for an ext4 driver for windows...
Nov 18 14:21:19 .:colo:.	ne2k: no, I've used it under similar conditions on bare metal running Debian without this particular problem...
Nov 18 14:21:33 .:ne2k:.	colo I wouldn't do that... what is the device and what are you tryihng to achieve?
Nov 18 14:21:48 .:shadow0x:.	hi
Nov 18 14:22:10 .:ne2k:.	colo oh yes, you said you'd tried the same Debian on metal and it was fine. was that on the same host hardware, though? (presumably not if it's an active esx host)
Nov 18 14:22:49 .:colo:.	ne2k: it's two hard disks with an ext4 filesystem on it that need the data copied over to a storage cluster in the DC. it's a one-time operation, and it needs to happen fast. since it's more than 20TB, I can't fuck around with USB 2.0 speeds.
Nov 18 14:23:19 .:colo:.	ne2k: no, different host hardware. but superspeed is no problem for this particular ESX host and its particular USB3 port
Nov 18 14:25:03 .:ne2k:.	colo you have hard disks that can transfer much faster than USB 2.0?
Nov 18 14:25:42 .:ne2k:.	I've always thought of hard disks as being able to do around 50 MByte/s, and USB 2.0 at 480 Mbit/s raw getting around 40 MByte/s goodput
Nov 18 14:25:53 .:ne2k:.	(I know this isn't your questions, but)
Nov 18 14:26:38 .:chovy:.	is there anything like ubuntu besides ubuntu
Nov 18 14:26:46 .:chovy:.	like a rolling releae of debian
Nov 18 14:28:44 .:colo:.	ne2k: these drives can do 220MB/s, so yes.
Nov 18 14:29:06 .:colo:.	chovy: no. consider testing or sid.
Nov 18 14:32:40 .:ne2k:.	colo that's a fast hard drive!
Nov 18 14:36:39 .:oori:.	hi. Is it possible to mount a command to a file? Like if I do "cat virtualfile.txt" then result of wget <someurl> is returned as content instead
Nov 18 14:36:51 .:djph:.	chovy: Debian and children don't do rolling-release (well sans Debian Sid maybe)
Nov 18 14:36:54 .:oori:.	it would be readonly ofc
Nov 18 14:37:09 .:ne2k:.	oori: there are fuse-based thingies that do that sort of thing for you
Nov 18 14:37:17 .:oori:.	oh
Nov 18 14:37:19 .:djph:.	oori: you mean you want to run the script "virtualfile.txt" ?
Nov 18 14:37:29 .:oori:.	djph: no
Nov 18 14:37:50 .:ne2k:.	oori: if you just want to do it once, you can do mkfifo virtualfile.txt; cat virtualfile.txt & wget <url> -O virtualfile.txt;
Nov 18 14:38:20 .:ne2k:.	or, for kluge, put your wget in a forever loop. but a bit klugey
Nov 18 14:38:23 .:oori:.	i need virtual.txt to appear as a text file, but the content to come from a website :D I was thinking webdav but dunnno
Nov 18 14:38:58 .:oori:.	there's no actual purpose here, just thinking about if it's possible
Nov 18 14:39:07 .:djph:.	uh ... no, that's not typically possible.
Nov 18 14:39:26 .:oori:.	not even with some VFS ?
Nov 18 14:40:07 .:djph:.	Files on block storage aren't really "dynamic" in the way it sounds like what you want.
Nov 18 14:40:54 .:oori:.	yeah, but doesn't the kernel only see VFS's through its api? I can't tell if the implementation is reading from disk or a cached webpage I think
Nov 18 14:41:07 .:oori:.	it can't*
Nov 18 14:42:19 .:ne2k:.	oori https://github.com/danielrozenberg/httpfs ?
Nov 18 14:44:14 .:djph:.	oori: yeah, but you'd need some actual _filesystem_ to plug in there.  But at that point, you're right back to block storage (inclusive of nfs or sshfs).
Nov 18 14:44:25 .:oori:.	ne2k: not quite
Nov 18 14:45:01 .:oori:.	ne2k: you have to reference the file with ~/http:
Nov 18 14:45:26 .:ne2k:.	djph you can absolutely have fuse-base virtual filesystems that present odd stuff as files to be read. there's one that live transcodes media files, for example.
Nov 18 15:19:02 .:oerheks:.	it should pull in libnss-mdns? /clear
Nov 18 15:25:58 .:mrig:.	Hello :) I've just been reading this: https://www.linuxbuzz.com/create-lvm-partition-in-linux/ and have formatted and setup the same on an ssd that is connected via usb. I was wondering what is the difference between this and the formatting of a disk that is mountable as a block device using udisksctl, that then appears in the distributions mount point, /dist/media/user/device ?
Nov 18 15:26:39 .:mrig:.	I can mount my device, as it now appears in /dev/group-name/voume-name
Nov 18 15:28:28 .:mrig:.	oh, seems that it might be device mapper that I need to understand.
Nov 18 15:28:48 .:porpulsion:.	what's the name of the config.. Device Drivers  ---> <*> NVM Express block device
Nov 18 15:31:10 .:tilt:.	mrig: udisks2 is a special subsystem that is active for the sake of file explorer applications. its main purpose is to detect the presence of removable media, mount it to a user-specific mountpoint and notify (via d-bus) applications such as the GNOME file manager that a new location is present
Nov 18 15:31:31 .:tilt:.	mrig: in short, it's a typical desktop thing, runs per user
Nov 18 15:32:00 .:tilt:.	mrig: you did it the proper way, which i would call the "static" or "server way" of formatting block storage
Nov 18 15:32:16 .:hangint3n:.	good morning
Nov 18 15:32:18 .:tilt:.	mrig: 👍
Nov 18 15:32:30 .:porpulsion:.	Device Drivers  --->
Nov 18 15:32:30 .:porpulsion:.	  <*> NVM Express block device
Nov 18 15:32:36 .:porpulsion:.	what's the name of the config?
Nov 18 15:32:57 .:mrig:.	oh right, is that keeping a cache of my virtual-group, the device stays in /dev/mapper even when unplugged?
Nov 18 15:33:04 .:tilt:.	porpulsion: you see that if you type ? or choose "help" in the interactive kernel config
Nov 18 15:33:24 .:tilt:.	mrig: no!
Nov 18 15:33:43 .:tilt:.	mrig: you can get an overview of everything attached and detected by dm with the command "lsblk"
Nov 18 15:34:26 .:tilt:.	mrig: what specifically happens here is that lvm2 is scanning the attached (!) blockdevices and determines if certain pvs, vgs and lvs are present
Nov 18 15:34:38 .:tilt:.	mrig: if yes, it registers block devices with dm
Nov 18 15:34:55 .:mrig:.	Yes, I've been using that one, now my drive appears as sdc rather than sdb when I connect it, is this due to the virtual group?
Nov 18 15:35:07 .:mrig:.	lsblk that is.
Nov 18 15:35:19 .:tilt:.	mrig: no, this is due to the unreliable naming of /dev/sd[a-z] devices
Nov 18 15:35:30 .:Gaboradon:.	Hello
Nov 18 15:35:46 .:mrig:.	ah ok, that could change on restarting.
Nov 18 15:35:57 .:tilt:.	mrig: a more reliable way is to use the block devices in /dev/disk/by-id/...
Nov 18 15:36:55 .:tilt:.	mrig: lvm is pretty smart but it's maybe not such a good idea (not very robust) to set up a vg on a removable device
Nov 18 15:37:07 .:Dagmar:.	It is a very _bad_ idea
Nov 18 15:37:19 .:Gaboradon:.	Does anyone know if a linux could support completely separate multi-monitor desktops, including that I limit keyboard and mouse (devices) to that specific desktop that only displays on that specific monitor, so double mouses (simultaneous use), and one mouse pointer can't cross ... not an extended desktop, but two separate desktops on same GPU.
Nov 18 15:37:24 .:tilt:.	:D in theory it can work
Nov 18 15:37:28 .:tilt:.	*gg*
Nov 18 15:37:49 .:Dagmar:.	Gaboradon: Yes, it's perfectly possible
Nov 18 15:37:52 .:tilt:.	you can also make a raid-5 from three usb sticks
Nov 18 15:37:53 .:Gaboradon:.	I know Win10 won't support this, it barely supports different virtual desktops on
Nov 18 15:38:14 .:Gaboradon:.	multiple monitors, when you switch to another virtual desktop it does it for both monitors.
Nov 18 15:38:22 .:mrig:.	tilt: oh I see, right yes, just really trying to familiarise by doing at the mo.
Nov 18 15:38:33 .:kaykay:.	On the plus side with windows, windows 11 finally has tabs in windows explorer.
Nov 18 15:38:46 .:Gaboradon:.	Dagmar: but which distro, DE ?
Nov 18 15:38:59 .:mrig:.	I am essentially setting up a disk for VM's and thought that it would be nice if I could resize it.
Nov 18 15:39:21 .:Gaboradon:.	Doable yes, if I spend 6 months making the code, but I was wondering for something that exists right now
Nov 18 15:39:23 .:mrig:.	I suppose best to make guid partitions if I want to divide it.
Nov 18 15:40:12 .:tilt:.	mrig: yes
Nov 18 15:40:22 .:tilt:.	mrig: that's what i did with my 128GB pendrive
Nov 18 15:40:39 .:tilt:.	mrig: put a gpt partition table on it, make two or more partitions
Nov 18 15:40:44 .:mrig:.	I was fascinated by the 'sudo wipefs --all --backup /dev/sdb' command, as there were things on the disk that was making all fs that I put on there odd sizes.
Nov 18 15:41:42 .:Dagmar:.	Gaboradon: Any distro or DE one wants to use that has X
Nov 18 15:45:35 .:mrig:.	that is probably where sdb when :|
Nov 18 15:46:22 .:mrig:.	I'd love to know how to code a very simple disk entry and file system in c, find it fascinating.
Nov 18 15:48:03 .:kaykay:.	Never too late to begin now mrig.
Nov 18 15:48:37 .:mrig:.	oh slowly slowly, I began quite a while ago, there is just so many domains and areas in the filed.
Nov 18 15:48:58 .:mrig:.	field rather.
Nov 18 15:51:54 .:mrig:.	I've a curious old machine that I'd like to get running with a very simple linux install, for learning this sort of thing, am learning about disks for that at the moment, as I've tried to create a restore disk for it using dd and that did not work.
Nov 18 15:53:12 .:live1:.	what exactly didn't work with dd?
Nov 18 15:53:33 .:mrig:.	It provides an application for making restore disks but it only runs on windows, seems that copying the image straight over is not enough, the system is expecting it to be set up in a certain way, I figured that if I make one, using a windows vm, I can the investigate it further.
Nov 18 15:53:55 .:mrig:.	The machine did not see it on booting.
Nov 18 15:55:22 .:live1:.	so you've launched a windows VM, on the older machine, right? and via windows and that application you've made a disk backup image, right? what's the application name?
Nov 18 15:55:56 .:mrig:.	no not yet, am investigating disks as the last thing that I want is a massive windows vm file clogging up my system.
Nov 18 15:56:36 .:tatiana:.	Hey
Nov 18 15:56:47 .:mrig:.	I did think of perhaps installing windows on the disk via usb, but I expect that would create boot order hassles, windows being the OS that it is.
Nov 18 15:57:25 .:live1:.	i don't understand you. where is the problem with dd and how come are we discussing windows OS installation?
Nov 18 15:57:31 .:mrig:.	the application is a exe supplied by the machines maker.
Nov 18 15:58:12 .:Dagmar:.	Try using a backup application written by someone who does know what they're doing
Nov 18 15:58:43 .:live1:.	so you've backuped the disk to an image with that application?

Nov 18 15:59:29 .:mrig:.	as does the app.
Nov 18 15:59:35 .:live1:.	so, the goal here is to install windows on that machine?
Nov 18 15:59:39 .:mrig:.	no
Nov 18 16:00:17 .:mrig:.	windows is not the goal at the moment, here, understanding disks filesystems and mounting is.
Nov 18 16:00:23 .:Dagmar:.	You did something wrong then
Nov 18 16:00:33 .:Dagmar:.	There's no reason using dd to write a disk image to an SD card won't work
Nov 18 16:00:42 .:mrig:.	it did work
Nov 18 16:00:52 .:live1:.	there are Dagmar, when encountering windows images
Nov 18 16:00:56 .:mrig:.	but the machine is not reading it when made in that way.
Nov 18 16:01:03 .:mrig:.	it is not a windows image.

Nov 18 16:01:11 .:Dagmar:.	You could also try, making sense
Nov 18 16:01:20 .:Dagmar:.	live1: No s**t sherlock
Nov 18 16:01:33 .:mrig:.	it is a curious debian 12 derivative for arm cortex8
Nov 18 16:01:46 .:Dagmar:.	An *.iso file is _not_ a "disk image"
Nov 18 16:01:50 .:live1:.	perhaps you need to write the image to sd card _with_ that application
Nov 18 16:02:10 .:mrig:.	that is why I am preparing a disk for a VM
Nov 18 16:02:21 .:mrig:.	or exploring disks and mounting further.
Nov 18 16:02:46 .:mrig:.	When I come to put my own OS on that SD card, I need to understand how it is working, what it is looking for to boot.
Nov 18 16:03:08 .:mrig:.	or some ancient linux, what ever, that is aside the point really.
Nov 18 16:03:32 .:live1:.	you want to understand the boot process of the machine
Nov 18 16:03:50 .:mrig:.	ive the info for doing this to hand but need to learn more about disks on linux first.
Nov 18 16:04:18 .:mrig:.	here: https://8i8.fr/public/Hercules_eCAFE-SlimEX-HD-SDK_V1.0.pdf
Nov 18 16:04:33 .:jmike__:.	man i need something to study and I don't want to study flash. :(
Nov 18 16:05:42 .:mrig:.	I've found that my understanding of disks on linux has a hole, between the bottom up mounting of disks using mount and the top down mounting using udisks2 that essentially makes it really confuddeling.
Nov 18 16:06:06 .:mrig:.	chipping away at it though.
Nov 18 16:06:14 .:Dagmar:.	That would because neither of those things is true
Nov 18 16:06:42 .:live1:.	what are you trying to accomplish?
Nov 18 16:06:52 .:mrig:.	Thank you tilt, that really cleared things up, will just go guid ;)
Nov 18 16:07:03 .:mrig:.	clarity,
Nov 18 16:07:37 .:mrig:.	:D not something that all are blessed with the ability to share.
Nov 18 16:08:15 .:richardbanger:.	speedtest-cli
Nov 18 16:08:17 .:richardbanger:.	good tool
Nov 18 16:08:35 .:clarity:.	mrig: meow
Nov 18 16:09:52 »»	mrig jumps up and down for joy, having found clarity!
Nov 18 16:14:39 .:live1:.	anyone working on something interesting?
Nov 18 16:15:36 .:mrig:.	Oh of course, when you make several partitions for a linux install, any that are lvm are pointed too by the /boot/evi and /boot sections and are never being attached and detached.
Nov 18 16:15:45 .:kaykay:.	Nothing in particular right now live1, but I'll see what the future holds for me.
Nov 18 16:17:04 .:kaykay:.	I gotta say, krita and blender are the perfect examples of how free software can be better than proprietary software. Krita is perfect for painting and blender can not only do 3D, but also replace flash itself with grease pencil.
Nov 18 16:18:40 .:live1:.	nice kaykay. i have lots of ideas and projects, but can't find the time/organise. i agree with you about blender and krita. by the way what's up with mentioning flash today? i see it for third-fourth time.
Nov 18 16:18:45 .:ananke:.	and which non-free products have you evaluated when making this comparison?
Nov 18 16:19:01 .:kaykay:.	I just out of habit call adobe animate flash.
Nov 18 16:19:53 .:richardbanger:.	2023 year of the linux
Nov 18 16:20:17 .:likeafox:.	is there a fundamental difference between an immutable os, and a live os?
Nov 18 16:20:22 .:kaykay:.	ananke, krita is trying to be a competitor to CSP which I find it to be doing a great job. Blender wasn't made for 2D animation, but grease pencil over the years evolved to where it can seriously compete with adobe animate.
Nov 18 16:21:26 .:live1:.	immutable is the way admin sets it up, further into the installation process and system configuration. live is not installed and will always come to the same point upon booting.
Nov 18 16:21:28 .:mrig:.	likeafox: immutable presumably never writes and can be stopped on a dime as there would be no integrity to check.
Nov 18 16:22:03 .:ananke:.	kaykay: interesting how first you claimed they were better, now you're saying that they're essentially worthy competitors
Nov 18 16:22:36 .:kaykay:.	Look, my wording wasn't the best, but you know exactly what I was trying to say anake.
Nov 18 16:24:03 .:mrig:.	Is there any real draw back or benefit to formatting fat over Ext4?
Nov 18 16:24:15 .:mrig:.	other than being portable to other systems.

Nov 20 16:31:32 .:hexnewbie:.	richardbanger: I found that cleaning the ball does little to help, as it doesn't get dirty at all if you clean regularly, it's the dust and lint accumulated on the metal rollers it turns that kills the mouse cursor motion

Nov 20 17:19:15 .:ramblebamble:.	just to clear it up... ./lego appears to not play well with active vpn-connections,, so problem solved.. thanks for your time
Nov 20 17:20:00 .:xx:.	on debian, I don't want newly installed services to be automatically enabled. Currently I do `echo 'disable *' >/etc/systemd/system-preset/00-default.preset` but I'm unsure about the 00- vs using 99-
Nov 20 17:20:23 .:ramblebamble:.	xx, use systemctl for that with the --disable switch
Nov 20 17:20:27 .:xx:.	other distros like archlinux have a file /lib/systemd/system-preset/99-default.preset
Nov 20 17:20:30 .:xx:.	ramblebamble: doesn't help
Nov 20 17:20:44 .:xx:.	debian *autostarts* a service right after it is installed
Nov 20 17:20:49 .:xx:.	I want to prevent that
Nov 20 17:21:04 .:xx:.	I could either mask the service in advance, which is a pain, or I could use the preset mechanic
Nov 20 17:21:12 .:xx:.	https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.preset.html
Nov 20 17:21:19 .:ramblebamble:.	xx arch does as well.
Nov 20 17:21:32 .:xx:.	and I am seeking advice about the order in which the files are loaded
Nov 20 17:21:33 .:ramblebamble:.	why do you wan to do that? what is your usecase??
Nov 20 17:21:55 .:xx:.	ramblebamble: generating system images without creating lots of temporary files because services are started
Nov 20 17:22:17 .:ramblebamble:.	xx, you can have services depend on one-another but to explicitly have them in order, that is not what systemd does.
Nov 20 17:22:25 .:xx:.	I don't think you get my point
Nov 20 17:22:51 .:ramblebamble:.	I do , you uwant system-images without a lot of cluter so you do not want to have them start up right away
Nov 20 17:23:18 .:xx:.	then what you said does not follow
Nov 20 17:23:55 .:xx:.	basically I need to know if I should name it /etc/systemd/system-preset/00-default.preset or /etc/systemd/system-preset/99-default.preset
Nov 20 17:24:17 .:ramblebamble:.	you were refering to a specific order in which files are loaded.
Nov 20 17:24:27 .:xx:.	yes
Nov 20 17:24:48 .:xx:.	because there are files such as /lib/systemd/system-preset/90-systemd.preset
Nov 20 17:24:54 .:ramblebamble:.	anyway, not that I am an authority in that regard but I don't think your use-case is covered, you will have to stop them and clean up afterwards alternatively
Nov 20 17:25:13 .:ramblebamble:.	create a base-image and install them by foot, meaning you extract the archive downloaded onto the system by hand.
Nov 20 17:25:18 .:xx:.	then you still don't see what I'm talking about and how the preset mechanic works

Nov 20 17:27:24 .:luna__:.	hackinghorn: not alone
Nov 20 17:27:32 .:luna__:.	djph: i don't have any tea
Nov 20 17:27:40 »»	ramblebamble looks at link
Nov 20 17:27:54 .:djph:.	luna__: shame.  I should make some, but that means getting up ...
Nov 20 17:28:06 .:hackinghorn:.	luna__, what drink do you usually have?
Nov 20 17:28:19 .:luna__:.	hackinghorn: soda, energy drinks or water
Nov 20 17:28:45 .:hackinghorn:.	ohh okay
Nov 20 17:28:57 .:hackinghorn:.	nice drinks, water is best!
Nov 20 17:30:43 .:ramblebamble:.	xx, ahh that what you mean... ok... and file-order refered to that default to off not the order of services.... yeah no clue.... what strikes me though is that the start-command might be part of the package NOT a systemd configuration
Nov 20 17:31:46 .:xx:.	ramblebamble: the start command is part of systemd
Nov 20 17:32:21 .:ramblebamble:.	xx yes, but disabling start is not the same as having the default turned to off
Nov 20 17:32:47 .:ramblebamble:.	so when the package executes a start-command with systemd I would expect systemd to exactly do that regardless of default
Nov 20 17:32:49 .:xx:.	true, but it's a very rare exception that a service gets explicitly started despite being disabled
Nov 20 17:33:00 .:xx:.	and for that, I'd need to use masking
Nov 20 17:33:14 .:xx:.	thankfully none of the packages I use fall in this exception
Nov 20 17:33:49 .:ramblebamble:.	and enabled means they are started at boot, when I guage this correctly not that they are not turned on, I can start apackage and it will be off on next boot

Nov 21 22:21:32 .:woland:.	is it possible to add virtual battery in virt-manager qemu?
Nov 21 22:27:59 .:xmppswiley:.	You could probably do it with egrep.
Nov 21 22:30:11 .:Sauvin:.	If you want two lines, maybe you want awk.
Nov 21 22:31:55 .:Namarrgon:.	SmashingX: timedatectl | sed -n '5,6p'
Nov 21 22:33:10 .:HvszrStykp:.	confused about how sector size impacts IO on spinning disks... if a drive reports 512 byte sectors to the OS, and the OS has a filesystem that uses 4k sectors, then is the OS going to be translating those 4k sectors into 512 and communicating with the drive in 512 sectors? which would degrade the performance, at least random read/write, if the drive has 4k "physical" sectors
Nov 21 22:34:29 .:superboot:.	I am reading about the kernel, and they refference a "task file" that lists PIDs that the OOM killer will save at the expense of other processes. Where is this file? (they don't say)
Nov 21 22:36:19 .:Namarrgon:.	what are you reading?
Nov 21 22:36:35 .:hodapp:.	it might be 'file' in the sense of 'register file' or the like, where it'd not really referring to a filesystem

Nov 21 22:37:15 .:SmashingX:.	Namarrgon Exactly what I needed, thank you very much!
Nov 21 22:37:26 .:superboot:.	hodapp: Where would you specify PIDs for the OOM killer to keep running?

Nov 22 01:16:18 .:epony:.	and the software already exists, it's called SpamAssassin (no relation to presidential electoral votes)
Nov 22 01:16:32 .:jim:.	chowbok, I think the biggest thing is as ops, unless trying to solve a serious behavioral problem, we try to not use force unless it's necessary to do so
Nov 22 01:17:09 .:Dagmar:.	Never write your own mail delivery functions if the language you're using has nice, safe ones available
Nov 22 01:17:13 .:epony:.	Python is used on some mailing lists because not everyone knows Perl

Nov 22 01:17:23 .:Dagmar:.	Just constructing multipart-MIME is a pain in the butt
Nov 22 01:18:12 .:Dagmar:.	...and unless you're familiar with handling really hostile and malicious data near shells, writing it yourself will just ensure you'll eventually get your own CVE report.
Nov 22 01:18:20 .:Sauvin:.	I looked at that briefly. Looked like a pain in other body parts, too.
Nov 22 01:18:27 .:epony:.	but if there is one thing to learn about email, that's how mail servers work really (internally)
Nov 22 01:18:46 .:Guest95:.	Also, Im wondering which web-framework is best/most full-stack/secure/updated etc, Django or Ruby on Rails?
Nov 22 01:18:47 .:chowbok:.	Yeah, it's helpful to be able to speak SMTP
Nov 22 01:19:01 .:epony:.	the filtering part has its own filtering language, it's called Sieve (unimaginatively)
Nov 22 01:19:36 .:epony:.	and the modules that extend the mail servers with filtering functionality are called "milter"s (again, mail filter.. so smart)
Nov 22 01:19:51 .:jim:.	chowbok, what I'm saying is... say you're getting offended by offtopic commentary... in -that- case, I might try to relocate the conversation... but if no one's being offended AND there's not much ONtopic traffic on the channel, I'm not really motivated to use force
Nov 22 01:20:22 .:chowbok:.	Who's offended? I just mentioned his comment seemed off-topic
Nov 22 01:20:36 .:epony:.	there are independent milters and perl milters and spam specific milters like spamassassin and clamav and spamc/spamd
Nov 22 01:20:52 .:chowbok:.	I don't know what you mean about "using force"
Nov 22 01:20:55 .:jim:.	chowbok, I didn't think so, I was just using that as an example
Nov 22 01:21:15 .:Sauvin:.	I'm often not moved at _all_ to redirect offtopic convo when it's not offensive, doesn't transgress Libera guidelines, doesn't interfere with "legitimate" traffic and doesn't threaten to heat up.
Nov 22 01:21:30 .:chowbok:.	All I did was mention it
Nov 22 01:21:30 .:epony:.	so the keyword filtering can be solved quite easy without you having to create the solution, but finding the module you need and reading up on the documentation (configuring it)
Nov 22 01:21:36 .:Sauvin:.	chowbok, basically, kicks, quiets or bans.
Nov 22 01:21:47 .:chowbok:.	I didn't do any of those things
Nov 22 01:21:58 .:jim:.	chowbok, "using force" would be kicking, banning, or demonstrating that I can do those things
Nov 22 01:22:23 .:chowbok:.	So why tell me? I didn't do any of those things, or threaten to.

Nov 22 01:23:14 .:epony:.	that's not a Python vs Ruby response, that's a Php direction for web frameworks, of which there are plenty even in Java and other languages
Nov 22 01:23:35 .:jim:.	chowbok, heh, you were the one who mention the comments may be offtopic... were you offended by this? I don't know... you say no, so that's what I assume
Nov 22 01:23:36 .:Sauvin:.	And EEWW, somebody said the P-word! PHP! WAUGH!
Nov 22 01:23:45 .:epony:.	Guest95, the parent of these is Perl (of course, for the web)
Nov 22 01:24:00 .:chowbok:.	For God's sake, all I said was "Not really clear how that's Linux-specific"
Nov 22 01:24:33 .:chowbok:.	I promise to never again even hint that something is off-topic.
Nov 22 01:24:34 .:epony:.	so your both filtering email, and web frameworks, and issue tracking and mailing lists, and system administration is really a Perl set of directions
Nov 22 01:24:58 .:epony:.	despite there beign Php, Python and last (least recommended) Ruby
Nov 22 01:25:04 .:jim:.	chowbok, and by saying that, you kinda invoke the ops to comment :)
Nov 22 01:25:10 .:chiselfuse:.	Does anyone here use x2x?
Nov 22 01:25:17 .:chowbok:.	That's ridiculous.
Nov 22 01:26:01 .:epony:.	since you mentioned promises, let's look at the promise theory then
Nov 22 01:26:19 »»	epony recommends CFEngine over Ansible
Nov 22 01:26:22 .:cartdrige:.	not recommending ruby because it's made by japaneses is unfair.
Nov 22 01:26:42 .:epony:.	no, it's not suitable for web work in general
Nov 22 01:27:12 .:chiselfuse:.	epony: I have been contemplating adopting CFEngine, do you use it heavily? How's it working out for you
Nov 22 01:27:25 .:epony:.	it's not working because I use BSD
Nov 22 01:27:36 .:chiselfuse:.	ehh?
Nov 22 01:27:39 .:epony:.	but on Linux, it's the agent vs agentless systems
Nov 22 01:27:51 .:epony:.	so with agentless and for Python fans, ansible should be good to go
Nov 22 01:28:06 .:chiselfuse:.	I'm mainly attracted to it because it's declarative unlike Ansible
Nov 22 01:28:13 .:epony:.	for non-Snake people, Perl and SSH ;-) and when the prototyping is not enough, CFEngine
Nov 22 01:28:17 .:chiselfuse:.	It's no Nix but
Nov 22 01:28:21 .:Guest95:.	Why do people use Perl?
Nov 22 01:28:23 .:epony:.	declarative is good
Nov 22 01:28:30 .:Guest95:.	What languages are identical in function to Perl?
Nov 22 01:28:32 .:epony:.	cause Perl is the mother tongue of the web
Nov 22 01:28:43 .:cartdrige:.	There's Lua and Rust now right?
Nov 22 01:28:52 .:cartdrige:.	Maybe Lua's not bad.
Nov 22 01:29:08 .:epony:.	Php and Python are Perl competitors for the web and system work / applications respectively
Nov 22 01:29:15 .:chiselfuse:.	epony: how often does it break?
Nov 22 01:29:16 .:chiselfuse:.	CFEngine
Nov 22 01:29:22 .:epony:.	it does not break
Nov 22 01:29:53 .:epony:.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_theory#Agency_as_a_model_of_systems_in_space_and_time
Nov 22 01:30:24 .:Mazis:.	I have a .txt file which contains lines such as "20n 55hn 1d 2u". As you can see, there are words such as "hn", "d", "u" prefixed before numbers. these numbers denote the value of the words that come immediately after it. All lines contain the four words "N, HN, D, U" with numbers. In my example, 20+55+1+2 adds up to 78. 25.6% of 78 is N. I want to
Nov 22 01:30:25 .:Mazis:.	calculate this for all lines, I want to find out what percentage is HN or D for example. How can one do this?
Nov 22 01:31:36 .:chiselfuse:.	epony: excuse me,, how often do systems managed by CFEngine break?
Nov 22 01:31:43 .:jim:.	chowbok, I don't really think it's that big a deal, by the way... but, when you mentioni the possibility that someone's being off topic,  it practically demands an op response, since we try to keep the channel topical
Nov 22 01:31:44 .:Mazis:.	can this be done with a single tricky command involving regex or would you need a script?
Nov 22 01:32:02 .:chiselfuse:.	epony: everything breaks
Nov 22 01:32:05 .:epony:.	I don't have observations on that, since it's quite reliable and can support hundreds of thousands of server nodes
Nov 22 01:32:41 .:epony:.	no, just scripting languages have limitations in runtimes and constraintes in time/space and collected dynamic memory
Nov 22 01:32:57 .:chowbok:.	Well, as I said, I'll never do it again.
Nov 22 01:33:31 .:chiselfuse:.	epony: not in that manner, does it never get a wrong version of a package or do you ever happen to misconfigure it (technically being your fault but also caused by obscurity of the tool you're using etc..)
Nov 22 01:33:44 .:jim:.	I'm gonna try to end this particular thread, it's getting noisy :) chowbok, have a good day/stay safe/be well
Nov 22 01:34:14 .:chiselfuse:.	teh irc dramaz on teh internets
Nov 22 01:34:16 .:epony:.	chiselfuse, it's not that naively implemented, obviously.. there are a couple of books about its design and internals
Nov 22 01:34:19 .:Mazis:.	line 1 for example has "20n 55hn 1d 2u", line 2 has "99n 31hn 0d 9u". all of these numbers add up to 217. of this, 54.8% of it is N. i want to do this for all lines
Nov 22 01:34:58 .:epony:.	there is a certain level of academic advancement that is separating naive and reliable systems

Nov 22 01:45:44 .:epony:.	and theen, the other point is, sometimes your distribution might make it hard for you to discover modules for languages because they don't package enough of properly the language you need, since it's a later version different shop of a scipting language with less support for your set of tasks

Nov 22 01:51:33 .:jim:.	Liver_K, something's wrong with the reference to a mirror of debian packages
Nov 22 01:51:34 .:Two_Dogs:.	opensuse uses mirrorbrain, no idea how it works, but it just works
Nov 22 01:51:53 .:Liver_K:.	using what software though
Nov 22 01:51:54 .:Liver_K:.	?
Nov 22 01:52:35 .:Two_Dogs:.	opensuse does not use apt
Nov 22 01:52:36 .:jim:.	Liver_K, debian uses apt for that
Nov 22 01:52:49 .:Liver_K:.	and this person is using which of these?
Nov 22 01:53:13 .:Liver_K:.	debian or opensuse
Nov 22 01:53:33 .:akoana:.	Mazis: still looking for a solultion?
Nov 22 01:53:45 .:Mazis:.	akoana: unfortunately yes
Nov 22 01:54:56 .:Mazis:.	akoana: it should be mentioned that sometimes, lines contain some extraneous stuff that should be ignored in the calculations. for example, line 8 might have "55h 28hn 9d 8u [bablablabla] yes it works".  many lines contain sentences and strings such as { which should be ignored. only *n *hn *d *u should be taken into account, with * being a
Nov 22 01:54:56 .:akoana:.	Mazis: maybe something like this https://termbin.com/nayz
Nov 22 01:54:56 .:Mazis:.	numerical value
Nov 22 01:56:43 .:akoana:.	it just considers the first four fields, maybe you'd have to filter lines with a regex...
Nov 22 01:56:51 .:Mazis:.	akoana: i want to calculate the value of all words, not just N
Nov 22 01:57:06 .:Liver_K:.	agh whatever i'll ask mine now, about the files in /sys/class/hwmon/, what exactly are they? and what uses them?
Nov 22 01:57:28 .:akoana:.	Mazis: I think given my example you could figure out that yourself...
Nov 22 01:58:25 .:Dagmar:.	That sort of thing is trivial in most languages that have regular expression capture groups
Nov 22 01:59:15 .:Dagmar:.	if (/^(\d+)\D+ (\d+)\D+ (\d+)\D+ (\d+)\D+ .*/) { print "$1 $2 $3 $4\n"; }
Nov 22 02:01:00 .:Mazis:.	Dagmar: how to do that on a .txt
Nov 22 02:03:01 .:Mazis:.	either way, the good people at #awk have provided a tolerable solution. thanks for the chitchats, Dagmar & akoana.
Nov 22 02:10:26 .:Liver_K:.	so does anybody know if landscape-sysinfo uses thermald for its temperature readings?
Nov 22 02:11:47 .:kfrench:.	Liver_K: use strace on it and find out
Nov 22 02:11:54 .:Liver_K:.	what is that?
Nov 22 02:12:06 .:kfrench:.	It will show you all of the syscalls that a process makes
Nov 22 02:12:10 .:Dagmar:.	Mazis: Mainly, using a programming language.  That example was in perl
Nov 22 02:12:16 .:Liver_K:.	oh i would not know how to read that
Nov 22 02:12:41 .:kfrench:.	I'm sure you know how to grep for thermald though
Nov 22 02:13:25 .:Liver_K:.	oh ok if thats it yeah
Nov 22 02:13:56 .:Dagmar:.	With as many days as this has been going on you could probably find a mailing list for the developer and just ask them
Nov 22 02:14:06 .:kfrench:.	I know
Nov 22 02:14:52 .:Liver_K:.	i am looking at the github repo for it now anyway
Nov 22 02:15:06 .:Liver_K:.	maybe i can manage to understand enough python to read it
Nov 22 02:15:21 .:kfrench:.	or just grep for thermald in the source
Nov 22 02:16:37 .:Liver_K:.	oh wow the sysinfo py script is actually really short
Nov 22 02:16:43 .:Liver_K:.	makes sense
Nov 22 02:21:08 .:rascul:.	Liver_K what are you trying to accomplish?
Nov 22 02:22:32 .:Liver_K:.	eh long story short, the landscape-sysinfo command gives incorrect temperature readings, i want to fix it with whatever tool it is using to find sensors, but first i have to find out which one it uses

Nov 26 02:25:44 .:akk:.	intelinside, it depends on your windowmanager. There are programs that can generate arbitrary keystrokes (the Ctrl+C part), but you have to have your WM or another program intercept the initial Fn.

Nov 26 05:01:00 .:rstrz:.	Source_Code: I think you just have to force push from what it sounds like
Nov 26 05:01:20 .:epony:.	it's typically the opposite direction of extension and redoing (and failing to make it a long lasting standard, cf amp and what not)
Nov 26 05:02:05 .:rstrz:.	I think you're talking about tags/releases? Source_Code that's the way to update those. I believe the Release UI in GitHub allows you to reset those based on the commit that the tag / Release is associated with.
Nov 26 05:02:08 .:epony:.	you don't expect to see Exim and Sendmail signatures ;-)
Nov 26 05:02:23 .:Source_Code:.	rstrz: I did try but the Source code archives remain the same; 12 days outdated...
Nov 26 05:03:54 .:perrierjouet:.	is weechat the best irc client ?
Nov 26 05:03:58 .:rstrz:.	Is the tag associated with the Release of the outdated code? Source_Code the interface for GitHub really rubs me the wrong way because it obfuscates a lot of core Git functionality
Nov 26 05:04:07 .:ayecee:.	perrierjouet: weechat users think so
Nov 26 05:04:37 .:rstrz:.	There should be an edit button on the page that shows you the release that looks outdated.
Nov 26 05:04:41 .:perrierjouet:.	maybe someone who uses irssi my first irc client can comment ?
Nov 26 05:04:53 .:ayecee:.	oh i'm sure they will
Nov 26 05:05:33 .:rstrz:.	I use igloo on mobile and irssi on desktop 🙃 perrierjouet
Nov 26 05:05:41 .:epony:.	here's the thing, they are glibc and string validation pestered (all of these mentions plus the other GUI populars)
Nov 26 05:06:00 .:Source_Code:.	rstrz: yeah, core functionality is missing on the site, but the cli makes up for it; except I can't edit Source code or Releases through cli afaik.  I'll try mess around with the tags
Nov 26 05:06:15 .:epony:.	so.. the "best" is, user features, on the network and in correctness and robustness, things are "equally rotten"

Nov 26 05:07:03 .:rstrz:.	It does support it by GH renames them in the UI. A "Release" is just a "tag" with a "message" attached. Source_Code
Nov 26 05:07:25 .:rstrz:.	But yeah give the tags a try. You may need to delete the tag on the remote and push it up again Source_Code
Nov 26 05:07:54 .:epony:.	one thing to remember is, BitchX is no more the "cool kids" IRC client (was suffering exploits in the early 2000s too)

Nov 26 05:31:34 .:epony:.	it's a bit short for an ultimate one but, not bad as a start ;-)
Nov 26 05:32:54 .:epony:.	ultimate would be a common format specification from which to distill various ports formats like for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD (pkgsrc), Gentoo (portage), Arch Linux (AUR), SRPM, DPKG etc
Nov 26 05:33:33 .:epony:.	there are a lot of those but they are make files and wrapper around tools for the system specific port (package) builder
Nov 26 05:34:45 .:epony:.	you can start by comparing popular software packaging in say Arch and Fedora, and see the source package formats and the build systems documentation
Nov 26 05:35:39 .:epony:.	there is a lot of complexity for a machine automation tooling there, where a human sorts out immediately and generates extra processing as needed
Nov 26 05:36:27 .:epony:.	because build systems differ and hosting facilities and software packaging and dependencies differ too
Nov 26 05:37:02 .:epony:.	for a one off case, you just close an adjacent similar software source package port and adjust it for your needs
Nov 26 05:37:47 .:epony:.	there are very concise docs in each of these systems for this
Nov 26 05:37:52 .:udfyh864:.	sh -c "$(cd ~/wpcle && java -jar getdown.jar . client -credentials credentials.txt en)" i am using this code to start package on debian xfce session & startup, does the code will have any side effects?

Dec 02 03:17:52 .:kawaiola:.	Hello Everyone, Does anyone have any experience with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1? I typically run RHEL but recently I had to take over support for a handful of SUSE machines and I'm having a hard time with updates.
Dec 02 03:18:54 .:Guest93:.	Hi, Im setting up Lubuntu 22.04, whats the maximum LUKS passphrase length? All answers I googled were years old. Thanks.
Dec 02 03:19:42 .:divad27182:.	ought to be more or less unlimited....
Dec 02 03:19:53 .:ayecee:.	do you suppose that's changed since then?
Dec 02 03:19:54 .:divad27182:.	don't know for sure
Dec 02 03:19:55 .:Guest93:.	i need an exact character limit
Dec 02 03:20:12 .:ayecee:.	for what?
Dec 02 03:20:20 .:rascul:.	kawaiola you're unlikely to get different help here than you got in #opensuse
Dec 02 03:20:25 .:hexnewbie:.	Guest93: I don't think there's a humanly reachable limit, but large passphrases are rarely used, so bugs with them may not be caught. Somebody here was complaining that their >128 letter passphrase stopped being accepted because the new Linux kernel changed the buffering of TTYs
Dec 02 03:20:37 .:Kenrin:.	do you really need more than 512
Dec 02 03:20:38 .:kawaiola:.	I believe it is 512 characters
Dec 02 03:20:47 .:Kenrin:.	that's an insane amount of characters already
Dec 02 03:20:54 .:Simbukka:.	Guest93: it was 512 characters like a year ago
Dec 02 03:20:59 .:ayecee:.	looks like cryptsetup --help will show the max password length.
Dec 02 03:21:11 .:kawaiola:.	rascul, okay thank you
Dec 02 03:21:16 .:divad27182:.	There could be two separate limits:  How long it may be, and how long you may enter
Dec 02 03:22:39 .:Guest93:.	yeah i just want to learn how long it will read
Dec 02 03:23:48 .:Guest93:.	can i change cryptsetup cipher option in terminal then install Lubuntu via gui
Dec 02 03:24:18 .:MrElendig:.	sure
Dec 02 03:24:40 .:Guest93:.	how
Dec 02 03:25:26 .:MrElendig:.	set up crypto and then tell it to install to the luks container (and set up the needed bits in the os by hand afterwards)?
Dec 02 03:25:40 .:Guest93:.	idk how to do that
Dec 02 03:25:51 .:MrElendig:.	sounds like a xyproblem though
Dec 02 03:25:59 .:Guest93:.	can u just change the cipher default
Dec 02 03:26:03 .:Guest93:.	can u
Dec 02 03:26:04 .:Guest93:.	can i
Dec 02 03:27:06 .:Guest93:.	yeah maximum length is 512
Dec 02 03:27:15 .:Guest93:.	Id like to change cryptsetup default
Dec 02 03:27:41 .:Guest93:.	so when ghe Gui installer runs, it works as normal just uses the cipher i choose instead of aes
Dec 02 03:28:07 .:divad27182:.	Well, I just created a luks encrption with a 4096 character key
Dec 02 03:28:39 .:divad27182:.	so the length is rather long, at least if you use a key file.

Dec 02 19:43:00 .:Sabotender:.	I think I found some helpful information. when I removed the gnome gui connection manager applet, did gnome-keyring go along with it?
Dec 02 19:43:30 .:fernis:.	:)
Dec 02 19:43:48 .:ayecee:.	Sabotender: you've got the apt logs there to find out
Dec 02 19:44:32 .:Sabotender:.	how do I check this information?
Dec 02 19:44:50 .:ayecee:.	first, find the apt logs. they're usually in /var/log, or maybe /var/log/apt
Dec 02 19:46:34 .:ayecee:.	then, read the history log, and find the lines relating to your original change. they're dated.
Dec 02 19:48:53 .:dksnd:.	where does lsusb takes its  data from?
Dec 02 19:49:05 .:ayecee:.	probably /sys somewhere
Dec 02 19:49:32 .:ayecee:.	could strace it to follow along at home
Dec 02 19:50:11 .:HyP3r:.	Heyho... How can I dynamically append a switch to a command call in bash by a variable? E.g. when foo=1 then I want to call rsync with "--exclude=..." but without this parameter when foo=0
Dec 02 19:51:01 .:ayecee:.	pretty much only by replacing the command with a wrapper, or a function, that checks that variable.
Dec 02 19:51:44 .:HyP3r:.	Maybe somehow so: "rsync ([ "$foo" = true ] && --exclude="asdf")"?
Dec 02 19:52:03 .:ayecee:.	nope
Dec 02 19:52:29 .:HyP3r:.	https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/446848
Dec 02 19:52:45 .:hexnewbie:.	HyP3r: Guessing doesn't help. Using arrays can help, however
Dec 02 19:53:00 .:hexnewbie:.	But those are more difficult, and require understanding of this level of syntax first
Dec 02 19:53:22 .:ayecee:.	HyP3r: this is different from what you described.
Dec 02 19:53:31 .:hexnewbie:.	HyP3r: Yeah, that stackexchange link gives you the array solution I was talking about
Dec 02 19:54:11 .:HyP3r:.	Yeah thank you guys :)
Dec 02 19:55:46 .:Sabotender:.	I haveaptfail in the first one what would the file be naed so I can exammine it via nano
Dec 02 19:56:26 .:ayecee:.	something garbled your last transmission. please repeat.
Dec 02 19:57:57 .:peetaur:.	HyP3r: command=(echo hello world);   if ... ; then command+=(bla); fi;  command+=(just to show bla goes in the middle too);  "${command[@]}"
Dec 02 19:58:09 .:peetaur:.	(replace ... with some variable or whatever you want or script won't run obviously)
Dec 02 19:58:22 .:HyP3r:.	Yeah I'm actually testing this
Dec 02 19:58:37 .:HyP3r:.	And I also would say that on all modern systems a new enought bash should be here to do this
Dec 02 19:59:45 .:Sabotender:.	oh I see them in the latter path that you provided
Dec 02 20:00:50 .:Sabotender:.	hmmm perhaps I should ust try to install via apt-get gnome-keyring, otherwise there might e something else that is included with minimal installations
Dec 02 20:01:09 .:Sabotender:.	because I dont want that applet installed again
Dec 02 20:02:28 .:ayecee:.	the applet and nmcli both talk to networkmanager. there's no conflict in having both installed.
Dec 02 20:03:30 .:kurbus:.	anyone know a good place to start kernel dev?
Dec 02 20:04:12 .:ayecee:.	compiling a kernel using your existing config file is a good start
Dec 02 20:04:26 .:rascul:.	make help
Dec 02 20:04:39 .:ghostbuster:.	i would say writing a driver is the easiest entry point
Dec 02 20:04:47 .:hexnewbie:.	Sabotender: Telling the applet (if you install it, and remove it; and *if* it's for network-manager, and not connman) to allow *all* users to use that wireless connection and its passphrase (in KDE those are two checkboxes), would allow you to use the connection with non-GNOME, whether nmcli or other frontend, without the need for a keyring. It will store the password in plaintext, though
Dec 02 20:05:04 .:kurbus:.	yeah, but like write a driver for what
Dec 02 20:05:11 .:kurbus:.	that's the hard part, finding what to do
Dec 02 20:05:23 .:ayecee:.	a device that you have, that doesn't have a driver.
Dec 02 20:05:34 .:ghostbuster:.	https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelJanitors
Dec 02 20:05:38 .:bmr:.	or
Dec 02 20:05:39 .:kurbus:.	i use macOS and most of everything has a driver
Dec 02 20:05:44 .:ghostbuster:.	lol
Dec 02 20:05:52 .:hexnewbie:.	ayecee: Unfortunately, the frontends talk to NetworkManager, but use their own password manager for logging into the APs, so if you move from KDE to GNOME or vice versa, connections stop working
Dec 02 20:06:00 .:bmr:.	a device that you have, that has a driver, but you learn how to profile it and find hotspots
Dec 02 20:06:02 .:bmr:.	and optimise it
Dec 02 20:06:13 .:ayecee:.	kurbus: here we're talking about linux kernel development. if you have something else in mind, better to lead with that.
Dec 02 20:06:22 .:hexnewbie:.	I wonder if that's been the source of Sabotender trouble since removing the applet, but I haven't been following close enough
Dec 02 20:06:27 .:bmr:.	can always make things better
Dec 02 20:06:41 .:ghostbuster:.	you're going to have a hard time doing linux kernel dev on macos
Dec 02 20:06:45 .:rascul:.	hexnewbie the problem has been going on (and evolving?) for over a week now
Dec 02 20:06:45 .:kurbus:.	ayecee: yeah its just there's not very many good options to start kernel dev
Dec 02 20:06:49 .:kurbus:.	and also the mailing list
Dec 02 20:06:54 .:rascul:.	it's hard to follow
Dec 02 20:06:56 .:kurbus:.	dreadful place
Dec 02 20:06:59 .:hexnewbie:.	rascul: That part I've noticed, which is why I haven't been following
Dec 02 20:07:07 .:ghostbuster:.	kurbus: it sounds like you don't really want to do kernel dev
Dec 02 20:07:17 .:kurbus:.	maybe its not meant for me then
Dec 02 20:07:23 .:bmr:.	a 0.5% increase in efficenty in any current network driver would probably make you eligable for the nobel prize in energysavings, too bad we would be the only ones know about it.
Dec 02 20:07:27 .:hexnewbie:.	And that I run from situation that involve breaking the working 😃
Dec 02 20:07:27 .:rascul:.	kurbus how well do you know c?
Dec 02 20:07:34 .:kurbus:.	just base c or c++
Dec 02 20:07:46 .:rascul:.	i didn't include the ++ for a reason
Dec 02 20:07:51 .:ghostbuster:.	lol
Dec 02 20:07:59 .:kurbus:.	meh, i took the codecademy course for cpp
Dec 02 20:07:59 .:ayecee:.	kurbus: really hard to do kernel development if you haven't picked a kernel to do development on.
Dec 02 20:08:01 .:kurbus:.	i can take the c one
Dec 02 20:08:07 .:rascul:.	specifically, because the linux kernel does not do c++
Dec 02 20:08:12 .:hexnewbie:.	rascul: OK, but when you excluded ++, did you mean C or C#?
Dec 02 20:08:19 .:kurbus:.	surely they're not too different right
Dec 02 20:08:22 .:rascul:.	hexnewbie well i didn't include # either!
Dec 02 20:08:26 .:ghostbuster:.	C and C++ are not really related languages anymore imho
Dec 02 20:08:34 .:Sabotender:.	I am just trying to determine why I am getting the error "secrets were required but not provided" even though I configured the connection to ask for the password prior to establishing the connection
Dec 02 20:08:37 .:rascul:.	kurbus kernel c is much different from c++

Dec 07 05:44:13 .:ayecee:.	usually means "make module" hasn't run yet
Dec 07 05:44:20 .:ayecee:.	err, "make modules"
Dec 07 05:45:07 .:apteryx:.	OK; I'll try that

Dec 07 05:48:37 »»	litharge sets modes (#linux -bo $a:norwood litharge)
Dec 07 05:52:43 .:apteryx:.	ah, I think that's because I had defined make-flags as "LOADADDR=0x10008000" "uImage" which caused the default target (all) to not run
Dec 07 05:54:57 .:apteryx:.	yes, that was it :-)
Dec 07 05:57:41 .:Oksanaa:.	Well, at least, I can confirm that an ordinary USB stick does show up in /dev/sd*, unlike Nokia 1.3 Android phone. Even though my ancient Linux laptop does not seem to mount it automagically.
Dec 07 05:58:43 .:ayecee:.	phones don't normally show up as block storage devices
Dec 07 06:00:40 .:Oksanaa:.	Well, on my laptop, USB sticks do not automount (mount -l does not see any /dev/sdb*), and that's highly inconvenient. But that's for later. For now: how do phones normally allow data transfer over USB cable?
Dec 07 06:00:57 .:ayecee:.	usually via mtp, media transfer protocol
Dec 07 06:01:13 .:Oksanaa:.	I reckon they do not set up USB networking, with IP and everything, to have sftp file transfers possible.
Dec 07 06:01:45 .:ayecee:.	correct
Dec 07 06:02:59 .:ayecee:.	there exists mtpfs, a fuse filesystem that uses libmtp to speak the phone lingo. there's other mtp programs too, but i don't know them offhand.
Dec 07 06:07:30 .:neoncortex:.	At one point, I just gave up, installed Apache,, and used a form to send the files from some phones to my computer.
Dec 07 06:08:15 .:Oksanaa:.	go-mtpfs : detect failed: no MTP devices found
Dec 07 06:08:42 .:ayecee:.	guess there's more to figure out first.
Dec 07 06:09:05 .:Oksanaa:.	neoncortex: Close. There is already Apache installed, I just don't know how to get a web form in it to send the files from phones to computer.
Dec 07 06:09:49 .:neoncortex:.	https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_file_upload.asp
Dec 07 06:09:55 .:Oksanaa:.	And AnyFtp throws connection aborted all the time, on large files at least. Photographs can pass through, videos are not likely to.
Dec 07 06:10:15 .:Oksanaa:.	neoncortex: Surely there is something simpler? Like, HTML?
Dec 07 06:10:34 .:neoncortex:.	Oksanaa: No, some scripting is needed.
Dec 07 06:10:57 .:ayecee:.	something has to receive and process the form response. html doesn't do that part.
Dec 07 06:11:23 .:Oksanaa:.	neoncortex: What for? input type="file" or something? Preferably allowing to pick multiple files, not just one?
Dec 07 06:11:39 .:ayecee:.	for receiving and processing the form response.
Dec 07 06:11:47 .:Oksanaa:.	ayecee: Ah, I see. Once form is submitted, something has to receive it.
Dec 07 06:12:13 .:neoncortex:.	This is for single files, but you can upload a directory.
Dec 07 06:15:12 .:lockywolf:.	What is kqueue good for?
Dec 07 06:15:57 .:ayecee:.	pretty good for a google keyword
Dec 07 06:16:26 .:Oksanaa:.	adb devices -l still empty, even with a different USB cable. Is it a case of misconfigured Android, or of a USB port falling off?
Dec 07 06:17:05 .:ayecee:.	has usb debugging been enabled in the developer settings on the phone?
Dec 07 06:17:23 .:ayecee:.	if not, adb wouldn't show it
Dec 07 06:17:33 .:sozuba:.	I have a 1TB hard disk that i want to recover some delted data from. I can't clone the whole disk as i don't have space to store it, so i want to just clone the free space. ONe way i think of doing that is to create a seperate partition out of the free space and then cloning just that partition. But, would creating a seperate partition out of empty space to clone it destroy data that can be
Dec 07 06:17:35 .:sozuba:.	recovered?
Dec 07 06:17:50 .:sozuba:.	is there any other solution to this
Dec 07 06:17:53 .:sozuba:.	?*
Dec 07 06:18:17 .:Oksanaa:.	sozuba: Might you have access to a library/campus computer with plenty of free space?
Dec 07 06:18:31 .:sozuba:.	Oksanaa, unfortunately no :(
Dec 07 06:19:02 .:ayecee:.	the solution would be to recover to a different disk
Dec 07 06:19:15 .:ayecee:.	with or without a clone
Dec 07 06:19:25 .:Oksanaa:.	Thank you! Adb works, go-mtpfs works.
Dec 07 06:20:25 .:sozuba:.	ayecee, yeah that's one more option and the last one, if no other laternative to directly recovering from the hard disk
Dec 07 06:20:36 .:sozuba:.	is there no way to clone just the freespace and recover from it?
Dec 07 06:21:03 .:ayecee:.	there is no easy way to do that, no.
Dec 07 06:21:27 .:sozuba:.	I have one more 1 TB to where i planning to store the recovered files.
Dec 07 06:21:33 .:sozuba:.	I am*
Dec 07 06:21:40 .:sozuba:.	ayecee, fair enough
Dec 07 06:22:14 .:sozuba:.	so, creating a seperate partition would destory recoverable data?
Dec 07 06:22:25 .:ayecee:.	yes
Dec 07 06:22:29 .:sozuba:.	i am going with reccovering directly from the drive
Dec 07 06:22:37 .:sozuba:.	thanks Oksanaa ayecee
Dec 07 06:23:46 .:sozuba:.	Oksanaa, i just logged in so didn;t know what you were discussing about earlier, I just notcied that adb works and go-mtpfs works. I just wat to add yeah go-mtpfs is awesome, always worked. :)
Dec 07 06:23:59 .:ayecee:.	it didn't work a moment ago
Dec 07 06:24:08 .:sozuba:.	ayecee, i mean for me, haha.
Dec 07 06:24:20 .:sozuba:.	meaning to say i love that tool/package
Dec 07 06:24:24 .:sozuba:.	not saying it is perfect
Dec 07 06:24:26 .:sozuba:.	:)
Dec 07 06:25:19 .:ayecee:.	just heard you talking about hard drives. just wanted to add that hard drives are awesome, always worked.
Dec 07 06:25:46 .:Oksanaa:.	Lolz
Dec 07 06:26:10 .:Oksanaa:.	Point is: go-mtpfs did not work because USB debugging was not enabled, so phone was not talking.
Dec 07 06:26:45 .:ayecee:.	mtp doesn't require usb debugging
Dec 07 06:27:20 .:Oksanaa:.	sozuba: I can commiserate, I had a ~10yo HDD fail on me, and I have not recovered it yet. I have tried to copy it over to new SSD, but I have not even tried to look into % of the data that is alive.
Dec 07 06:27:25 .:ayecee:.	but maybe enabling usb debugging changed the usb configuration in other ways.

Dec 07 23:46:27 .:Sabotender:.	I was so excited that my wireless adapter worked right outside the box but itss like I can't catch a break because its always something that's presenting me with problems
Dec 07 23:46:37 .:Sabotender:.	so is this called a terminal emulator?
Dec 07 23:46:54 .:festive_kurbus:.	gpt?
Dec 07 23:47:21 .:chilled-entity62:.	I started reading the bash man pages, immediately executed bash -D. How do I exit it?
Dec 07 23:47:27 .:festive_kurbus:.	exit vim
Dec 07 23:47:29 .:ayecee:.	sounds like a virtual console rather than a terminal emulator.
Dec 07 23:48:08 .:Sabotender:.	ah ha that's the term I couldn't think of. thank you very much for this information
Dec 07 23:49:08 .:ayecee:.	chilled-entity62: doesn't seem like that should do anything that one would need to exit from.
Dec 07 23:49:55 .:ayecee:.	chilled-entity62: however running "exit" should do it.
Dec 07 23:50:20 .:ayecee:.	or ctrl-D
Dec 07 23:50:27 .:chilled-entity62:.	that's the first thing I did "exit
Dec 07 23:50:34 .:chilled-entity62:.	"exit"*
Dec 07 23:50:50 .:ayecee:.	yeah, i see what that does now. ctrl-D will work.
Dec 07 23:51:54 .:chilled-entity62:.	thank you!! Yeah I didn't finish reading to the line "This

Dec 07 23:56:15 .:ayecee:.	no polls please
Dec 07 23:57:29 .:Sabotender:.	hmm virtual console doesnt produce helpful results. mmaybe is it tty console?
Dec 07 23:57:34 .:Blohsh:.	ayecee, i want to switch to something rock solid, so thats why asking community what they prefer without issues
Dec 07 23:58:06 .:osh:.	linux mint xfce with twisterOS ontop for theming, I love it
Dec 07 23:58:16 .:ayecee:.	Sabotender: maybe
Dec 07 23:58:50 .:ayecee:.	Blohsh: then maybe lead with that.
Dec 07 23:59:10 .:Sabotender:.	whatever cli I am seeing when I turn on the computer and am at the login command line section

Dec 08 00:00:31 .:Blohsh:.	osh, thanks looks nice!
Dec 08 00:00:36 .:neoncortex:.	What's that exactly?  https://twisteros.com/about.html , a theme pack?
Dec 08 00:00:58 .:akoana:.	ayecee: bash's -n option is a bit hidden in the bash manual, but it's documented under builtins, set (see also: help set | grep -- -n  ... "-n  Read commands but do not execute them.") and all  set -<option> can be specified as bash -<option>
Dec 08 00:01:04 .:osh:.	yeah basically just some extreme theming

Dec 08 00:01:24 .:osh:.	to make xfce look like different windows versions, macs, etc

Dec 09 06:06:43 .:Sauvin:.	Except, if I read correctly, entries have to be sortable.
Dec 09 06:06:47 .:rascul:.	basically a uuidv4
Dec 09 06:08:19 .:loganlee:.	i found out even jumbo jets run windows 11
Dec 09 06:08:33 .:Khaytsus:.	Speaking of random
Dec 09 06:08:38 .:rustyaxe:.	no just the crappy infotainment junk :P
Dec 09 06:08:41 .:rustyaxe:.	which is why it never works
Dec 09 06:09:08 .:rascul:.	very short unique id is possible but because of high collision chance you have to check for collisions
Dec 09 06:09:18 .:rbox:.	WHEN id's collide...
Dec 09 06:09:20 .:Khaytsus:.	rustyaxe: I played a game on an airplane once you could hit down on the screen and a button.  I told the wife I was going to try hitting both at the same time to see if I could go below 1.
Dec 09 06:09:25 .:rascul:.	it needs to be sortable though?
Dec 09 06:09:34 .:Khaytsus:.	YOU BETTER NOT was the response I got, plus claw marks on the hand.
Dec 09 06:10:04 .:Khaytsus:.	Yes I know they're isolated from everything, or you'd hope :D
Dec 09 06:10:06 .:rascul:.	i think a base 62 of a timestamp + something would be sortable except for some rare edge cases
Dec 09 06:10:40 .:rascul:.	Khaytsus did you, though?
Dec 09 06:10:46 .:Khaytsus:.	I like solving problems people don't really have.
Dec 09 06:10:50 .:Khaytsus:.	rascul: I did.  I lived.
Dec 09 06:11:52 .:Khaytsus:.	rascul: And it did, in fact, go to 0.  For a split second, then bounced up to 1.
Dec 09 06:12:09 .:Khaytsus:.	So they had boundary checking and some periodic refresh check.
Dec 09 06:17:57 .:blahboybaz:.	With ecma regex I don't understand why "@" and "." aren't being matched. Or are they and I'm mis-reading the result?
Dec 09 06:18:00 .:blahboybaz:.	https://regex101.com/r/XCn0zu/1
Dec 09 06:19:17 .:donofrio_:.	anyone seen this and know what package I'm missing? xlib: extention "DPMS" missing on display
Dec 09 06:24:22 .:loganlee:.	donofrio_, google it
Dec 09 06:27:48 .:Khaytsus:.	loganlee: No, don't do that.
Dec 09 06:28:05 .:blinux:.	Does anyone know the difference between a binary listed at linux-64bit vs. linux-amd64? This is for hugo tar.gz file listed here: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.108.0
Dec 09 06:28:11 .:Khaytsus:.	If you're just going to say "google it" the very least you can do is some context about what to look for.
Dec 09 06:28:38 .:blahboybaz:.	I figured it out
Dec 09 06:29:03 .:ananke:.	blinux: download and inspect
Dec 09 06:29:34 .:Khaytsus:.	blinux: amd64 == x86-64)
Dec 09 06:29:38 .:Khaytsus:.	But otherwise, no idea
Dec 09 06:30:04 .:blinux:.	Khaytsus, Yeah, me too. I know amd64 is x86-64, but never seen just "64bit"
Dec 09 06:30:07 .:ananke:.	blinux: 'file' command will be useful
Dec 09 06:30:34 .:sheep:.	"64bit" alone doesn't really mean anything useful in this context
Dec 09 06:30:36 .:d00p:.	 are you sure linux-64bit isnt an archived file?
Dec 09 06:30:48 .:sheep:.	you should let the developers of this thing know that their file naming scheme is confusing
Dec 09 06:31:07 .:d00p:.	zip,gz,bz,
Dec 09 06:31:28 .:ananke:.	it may be something as simple as 'we named it this way back in the day, and we're keeping up with tradition, so automated downloads won't break'
Dec 09 06:31:52 .:blinux:.	The file command says that the linux-64bit file is "ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked"
Dec 09 06:32:09 .:ananke:.	blinux: now compare it to the amd64 one
Dec 09 06:32:20 .:ananke:.	bet you a shiny nickel it will be the same
Dec 09 06:32:31 .:d00p:.	^
Dec 09 06:33:35 .:ananke:.	and sure enough, they're identical binaries.
Dec 09 06:34:36 .:blinux:.	the amd64 says "ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked"
Dec 09 06:34:40 .:blinux:.	Same thing
Dec 09 06:34:49 »»	kfrench give ananke a shiny nickel.
Dec 09 06:35:23 .:ananke:.	if you compare hashes, they're identical. it's simply packaged with a different naming scheme
Dec 09 06:35:31 .:ananke:.	kfrench: I'm rich!
Dec 09 06:36:01 .:blinux:.	OK, that is weird they would make two files.
Dec 09 06:36:30 .:apteryx:.	hello!  that's the init crashing, right? https://paste.debian.net/1263384/
Dec 09 06:36:32 .:rbox:.	would it be better if they had 3?
Dec 09 06:37:13 .:blinux:.	rbox, They should have made a third file called "8byte"

I use Firefox for web-browsing, and it keeps crashing (This has happened to me on 2 different linux distros installed from scratch, they were both VMs with the same host). Which Linux distro has the most stable and reliable UI/GUI (firefox not crashing, UI not getting stuck, etc...(?
Dec 09 07:20:53 .:loganlee:.	eawfaw, maybe don't install from scratch?
Dec 09 07:21:20 .:eawfaw:.	Mmmmm what do you suggest?
Dec 09 07:21:31 .:loganlee:.	ubuntu is usually good

Dec 09 07:23:46 .:Two_Dogs:.	firefox likes to crash
Dec 09 07:24:06 .:Two_Dogs:.	just because
Dec 09 07:24:27 .:eawfaw:.	I've had issues with lots of apps, firefox is just an example
Dec 09 07:24:38 .:eawfaw:.	KWrite used to crash a lot
Dec 09 07:25:24 .:Two_Dogs:.	maybe you got hardware issues
Dec 09 07:25:29 .:eawfaw:.	I also get black screens, sometimes I can restart from a terminal, sometimes its complextly  stuck
Dec 09 07:25:33 .:Two_Dogs:.	watch the logs

Dec 09 07:26:35 .:Two_Dogs:.	this one 'sudo journalctl -b --pri3' from terminal, them are errors

Dec 09 07:27:48 .:Two_Dogs:.	it can be ran anytime after boot
Dec 09 07:28:10 .:Two_Dogs:.	some of them errors sneak in on boot :)

Dec 09 07:33:21 .:tarel2:.	Under Windows , I see a blue light on my usb wifi dongle , under Linux should I see the same light?
Dec 09 07:33:24 .:Two_Dogs:.	opensuse Tumbleweed
Dec 09 07:33:47 .:Sauvin:.	Interesting. I'm not used to seeing people reporting stuff crashing under Suse.
Dec 09 07:34:08 .:Two_Dogs:.	Sauvin, perhaps its just me
Dec 09 07:51:27 .:lockywolf:.	eawfaw: what are your VM parameters? if your VM has too little RAM, programs might crash
Dec 09 07:52:08 .:eawfaw:.	8 GB
Dec 09 07:53:33 .:loganlee:.	lol that's more ram than my laptop i'm using
Dec 09 07:56:10 .:lockywolf:.	looks fine
Dec 09 07:56:29 .:lockywolf:.	eawfaw: do you use some strict ulimit parameters?
Dec 09 07:57:26 .:eawfaw:.	nope, its basically a default workstation install + firefox
Dec 09 08:00:27 .:loganlee:.	hmmmmmm
Dec 09 08:00:56 .:rascul:.	my firefox never crashes on my opensuse tumbleweed
Dec 09 08:01:18 .:rascul:.	but i don't use opensuse's package
Dec 09 08:01:25 .:lockywolf:.	for me, firefox also does not really crash
Dec 09 08:01:44 .:lockywolf:.	but I don't bother too much and always use Slackware's stock Firefox
Dec 09 08:01:46 .:rouji:.	I do use the package on tumbleweed and it doesn't ever crash
Dec 09 08:02:02 .:rascul:.	i use the binaries from mozilla that i install in ~ somewhere and i let it autoupdate and sometimes it goes months before i remember to restart it for updates
Dec 09 08:02:05 .:lockywolf:.	also worked fine on xwayland, although I was not satisfied with wayland and went back
Dec 09 08:02:07 .:lockywolf:.	to X11
Dec 09 08:02:27 .:rascul:.	blackbox doesn't do wayland
Dec 09 08:02:40 .:rascul:.	and i haven't tried hard enough to do wayland anyway
Dec 09 08:02:53 .:rascul:.	one day i might
Dec 09 08:03:12 .:rascul:.	but it'll be hard to give up blackbox
Dec 09 08:03:27 .:loganlee:.	i just stick with modern desktop managers
Dec 09 08:04:03 .:rascul:.	the modern ones suck
Dec 09 08:04:28 .:rascul:.	usability has gone downhill in the last decade or two
Dec 09 08:04:29 .:loganlee:.	i'm using ubuntu mate right now on this low-spec laptop
Dec 09 08:04:51 .:rascul:.	yeah low spec doesn't matter, they run most things just fine

Dec 09 08:13:12 .:ayecee:.	who's gonna stop you
Dec 09 08:13:14 .:sheep:.	no. they could have files that have different metadata but the same contents. or they might use different compression settings but have the same content

Dec 09 08:15:31 .:rascul:.	might also be the same files but in a different order
Dec 09 08:16:23 .:CrtxReavr:.	Well. . . you could normalize a listing of the tar file.
Dec 09 08:16:51 .:rascul:.	oh yeah, listings
Dec 09 08:16:55 .:rascul:.	just cheat then
