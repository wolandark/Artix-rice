Nov 16 19:46:28 .:bea:.	doesnt that disqualify the rising edge of any ballistic curve from being ballistic
Nov 16 19:47:16 .:BrainDamage:.	depends, if it's a powered rise, then it's not ballistic, if it's unpowered, then it's ballistic
Nov 16 19:47:22 .:+SysGhost:.	bea: only initially when propelled by some explosion behind it. Once something has left that area of acceleration (i.e. the barrel) it's all trajectory.
Nov 16 19:47:48 .:+SysGhost:.	ballistic trajectory*
Nov 16 19:47:52 .:BrainDamage:.	yep, you can divide the powered portion as not-ballistic, and the unpowered as ballistic
Nov 16 19:48:10 .:BrainDamage:.	the icbm, while rising are indeed not ballistic, when they cut off the engines, they are
Nov 16 19:48:35 .:+SysGhost:.	Rockets usually have their own engines or at least fins to steer with. 
Nov 16 19:49:04 .:bea:.	I dont think a legal framework exists that allows rockets to own property
Nov 16 19:49:08 .:BrainDamage:.	if you shoot a projectile upwards, while it's in the barrel it's accelerated by the gas, so it's not ballistic, once it exits the barrel and continoues on its own, it's ballistic
Nov 16 19:49:18 .:niki:.	:3
Nov 16 19:49:25 .:niki:.	 in my field of physics ballistic just means 'constant velocity' weirdly enough, but then there is lots of weird stuff like that in science, like what astrophysicists call "metal"
Nov 16 19:49:46 .:BrainDamage:.	ah yes, anything > He is a metal ?
Nov 16 19:50:08 .:niki:.	something like that yes
Nov 16 19:50:13 .:+SysGhost:.	One would think that shooting the Excalibur artillery with an artillery cannon is all about trajectory as it is with other common artillery cannons. But the Excalibur ammunition got onboard computer, GPS and some steering.
Nov 16 19:50:16 .:paulguy_:.	what if it's an airplane flung by a ballista?
Nov 16 19:51:00 .:+SysGhost:.	paulguy_: wings still cause lift and will allow steering by the onboard meat computer (i.e. the pilot)
Nov 16 19:52:16 .:niki:.	I guess it must be rotationally symmetric for BrainDamage to accept it as ballistic or there will always be some kind of lift
Nov 16 19:52:25 .:niki:.	except in vacuum of course :p
Nov 16 19:52:36 .:BrainDamage:.	it's not my definition, but i'm not that pedant

Nov 17 06:01:47 .:bluetail:.	paulguy_ sad thing in 2022... I wouldnt wonder if those were prohibited because they are "sexist"

Nov 17 06:03:55 .:tent405:.	i mean, those ones are easy to get, but ffs should have a printed shirt that just says "baggage handler" on it
Nov 17 06:04:01 .:paulguy_:.	i don't think anybody is suggesting there's anything problematic with any of those things
Nov 17 06:04:12 .:paulguy_:.	i mean, maybe if the ghost costume is shaped in a particular way..
Nov 17 06:04:51 .:bluetail:.	Arent u automatically labeled a pedo if you openly state you find somebody cute whos not adult? I'm sick and tired of what media presented.

Nov 17 06:05:00 .:tent405:.	ghost costumes? well there's that weird transparent polymer trick
Nov 17 06:05:23 .:tent405:.	who knows, according to the cia documents, china already has invisibility suits. i heard it from jack ryan.
Nov 17 06:05:27 .:paulguy_:.	heh nah i mean if it looks like KKK robes
Nov 17 06:05:48 .:wallabra:.	why are my tabs 8 long right now :(
Nov 17 06:05:56 .:tent405:.	doesn't everyone know that KKK robes are a rip-off of an older catholic traditional penitent robe?

Nov 17 06:06:11 .:tent405:.	:remap tab
Nov 17 06:06:17 .:bluetail:.	tent405 they only make it so that you can see the object behind the person, but not the person. But a skillful person can see them when nearby
Nov 17 06:06:25 .:bluetail:.	theres also the invisibility shield...
Nov 17 06:06:42 .:paulguy_:.	i don't really care what they used to be, and it's not like catholics aren't all that innocent as far as being hateful and abusive goes.
Nov 17 06:06:44 .:tent405:.	ghillie suits were only invented in the 1800s gimme a break
Nov 17 06:06:49 .:wallabra:.	tabstop, thanks!

Nov 17 06:07:29 .:wallabra:.	what do you think I am, an IRC boomer?
Nov 17 06:07:33 .:wallabra:.	i was born in 2003
Nov 17 06:07:40 .:tent405:.	sorry
Nov 17 06:07:50 .:tent405:.	i mean i feel sorry for you, that must be tought
Nov 17 06:08:17 .:tent405:.	well, welcome, i guess
Nov 17 06:08:18 .:wallabra:.	nah it's very good actually
Nov 17 06:08:22 .:tent405:.	!phrik welcome
Nov 17 06:08:22 .:phrik:.	tent405: The answer is 42.
Nov 17 06:08:35 .:wallabra:.	you wish you were young again
Nov 17 06:09:01 .:tent405:.	funnily enough, due to the power of the razor, i am. 
Nov 17 06:09:02 .:bluetail:.	wallabra what interesting thing do you do one can only do when young?
Nov 17 06:09:20 .:wallabra:.	paulguy_, I don't know where 8 character long tabs came from. I'm sure there is an origin story. But I hate them.
Nov 17 06:09:33 .:wallabra:.	bluetail, I can sit in all sorts of unhealthy positions unpunished!... for now
Nov 17 06:09:36 .:paulguy_:.	probably something about typewriters
Nov 17 06:09:46 .:tent405:.	it's shit. it always is and always will be. vim still hates some indents.
Nov 17 06:09:57 .:wallabra:.	Heh. It had to be typewriters!
Nov 17 06:09:58 .:bluetail:.	wallabra you have the most comfortable butt in the world
Nov 17 06:10:03 .:wallabra:.	Ah I'm using neovim, learning to use all the vim shortcuts and whatnot
Nov 17 06:10:16 .:wallabra:.	bluetail, I'd let you know :)
Nov 17 06:10:17 .:dimbulb:.	I should move to neovim at some point.
Nov 17 06:10:21 .:paulguy_:.	my butt is comfortable when i'm actively doing squats and cardio and stuff :p
Nov 17 06:10:38 .:tent405:.	you'll never learn it all. i've been using it for a dozen years. still don't get it. yes, yes, neovim, etc. just use a typewriter.
Nov 17 06:11:23 .:tent405:.	when a text editor becomes so popular there are conferences about it i just don't know
Nov 17 06:11:24 .:wallabra:.	lol
Nov 17 06:11:36 .:tent405:.	are we even using these interfaces correctly?
Nov 17 06:11:37 .:bluetail:.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHKiGl02NmU
Nov 17 06:11:57 .:wallabra:.	vim is idiosyncratic and kinda silly
Nov 17 06:12:08 .:paulguy_:.	could you imagine the banter going on between presentations at a vim conference?
Nov 17 06:12:12 .:tent405:.	bluetail: don hertzfeld maybe
Nov 17 06:12:13 .:wallabra:.	i used to avoid it actively
Nov 17 06:12:24 .:dimbulb:.	they secretly talk about emacs
Nov 17 06:12:28 .:wallabra:.	a wealth of shortcuts to learn, i'm not good at that kinda stuff, but it seems cool and helpful and I probably should spend the time learning it up
Nov 17 06:12:46 .:paulguy_:.	i use vim now but i found the average user of it to be ... unwelcoming and competitive about their workflow.
Nov 17 06:12:59 .:paulguy_:.	so i avoided it for a long time just thinking it'd be too hard
Nov 17 06:13:23 .:tent405:.	paulguy_: i like to share with people how i got to where i am with it, but, it's hard to bring people up to speed
Nov 17 06:13:27 .:wallabra:.	yeah
Nov 17 06:13:30 .:dimbulb:.	I think you're going to get that when you deal with someone who uses what editor they're using as a part of their identity.
Nov 17 06:13:41 .:wallabra:.	people who use vim and people who use emacs, tend to be cunts
Nov 17 06:13:44 .:wallabra:.	i'm not a cunt though
Nov 17 06:13:48 .:tent405:.	msword.exe is a fine text editor
Nov 17 06:13:59 .:paulguy_:.	wordpad.exe
Nov 17 06:14:05 .:tent405:.	available on every system
Nov 17 06:14:17 .:tent405:.	even has formatting, just click it, with your mouse
Nov 17 06:14:33 .:paulguy_:.	you probably can use wordpad fully with a keyboard
Nov 17 06:14:42 .:tent405:.	true

Nov 17 06:16:48 .:tent405:.	maybe the softened up the rough edges in gnome desktop but still. ubuntu switching from gnome2→3 always left me angry.
Nov 17 06:18:59 .:paulguy_:.	vimtooter
Nov 17 06:20:34 .:tent405:.	i want to draw the learning curve that is it. thank god for the internet for detailed problems like how to output :verbose map to a buffer
Nov 17 06:21:39 .:tent405:.	Unless you're using it in production it doesn't matter, otherwise we toy with it *LSmith moment*
Nov 17 06:23:58 .:tent405:.	paulguy_: you still have a underscore is that normal now?
Nov 17 06:25:01 .:paulguy_:.	i imagine it'll revert back if i reboot
Nov 17 06:25:15 .:paulguy_:.	or close my IRC client for whatever reason
Nov 17 06:47:53 .:wallabra:.	paulguy_ just likes having a tail and doesn't want to admit it. :3
Nov 17 06:48:52 »»	paulguy_ knocks some stuff off of various tables with it
Nov 17 06:51:49 .:wallabra:.	Why do we have so many tables?!
Nov 17 06:52:31 .:paulguy_:.	liminal space table room with no chairs
Nov 17 06:52:44 .:ectospasm:.	I was a forced convert to vi, and I picked up vim about five years later.
Nov 17 06:53:43 .:ectospasm:.	Originally I prefered emacs, but when I had an internship using an HP-UX system, the sysadmin wouldn't install emacs for me, so he forced me to learn vi
Nov 17 06:54:13 .:paulguy_:.	original vi is poopy
Nov 17 06:54:33 .:ectospasm:.	It took me ten years to get over hitting Ctrl-x, Ctrl-s reflexively to save and quit editing a file.
Nov 17 06:55:31 .:ectospasm:.	I've been on systems that didn't have vim, so when I instinctively try to run vim and it says command not found, I just run alias vim=vi and I can usually keep working.
Nov 17 06:56:15 .:paulguy_:.	i just remember vi being weird, but maybe if i tried it again it'd be ok
Nov 17 06:56:19 .:ectospasm:.	It used to be rare that I came across anything vi couldn't do but vim could, and then I started filling my .vimrc with stuff.
Nov 17 06:56:49 .:ectospasm:.	Mostly it's color scheme, and the nmap, imap, etc. stuff doesn't work the same as vi
Nov 17 06:57:19 .:ectospasm:.	I use a Chrome plugin at work that turns many text input fields to a vi editor, called wasavi
Nov 17 06:57:29 .:ectospasm:.	It uses vi, not vim
Nov 17 06:57:37 .:ectospasm:.	So its config is vi config, not vim
Nov 17 06:59:13 .:ectospasm:.	I don't use wasavi all the time, only when I'm editing a message and so-called "normal" text editing isn't performant enough.
Nov 17 06:59:49 .:paulguy_:.	i see
Nov 17 07:00:07 .:ectospasm:.	unfortunately wasavi doesn't work everywhere
Nov 17 07:00:07 .:paulguy_:.	i probably can't think fast enough that my typing is too slow
Nov 17 07:00:24 .:ectospasm:.	I could really use it in Confluence, and it doesn't really work there
Nov 17 07:00:34 .:paulguy_:.	for stuff like code though a lot of the stuff is useful
Nov 17 07:01:26 .:ectospasm:.	I do use vim as my main email editor, but that's because I use mutt as my main email client.
Nov 17 07:01:36 .:ectospasm:.	At work and home.
Nov 17 07:13:48 .:tent405:.	wallabra: tables aren't a problem just TRUNCATE em
Nov 17 07:13:56 .:wallabra:.	good idea
Nov 17 07:14:30 .:tent405:.	speaking of ectospasm i don't think that the nvim<>vim divide is problematic
Nov 17 07:14:51 .:tent405:.	if you had to be forced into a binary system then just write the confs to deal with it
Nov 17 07:14:56 .:wallabra:.	Chrome?
Nov 17 07:15:03 .:wallabra:.	ehh
Nov 17 07:15:16 .:tent405:.	that's what you coat your hogger yanno the semi truck thing
Nov 17 07:15:24 .:wallabra:.	also I can type fast enough that I don't really get much of a boost from modal (Vi-style) editing
Nov 17 07:15:57 .:wallabra:.	last I checked, around 150 wpm
Nov 17 07:15:57 .:ectospasm:.	I can type almost as fast as I think.  Usually about 80wpm, maybe up to a 100wpm if I'm feeling frisky
Nov 17 07:15:58 .:tent405:.	if i had to learn line-edit readline cursor magic i'd get another 10 years on my life fuck that
Nov 17 07:16:10 .:tent405:.	i tried chasing colemak
Nov 17 07:16:13 .:tent405:.	fuck that
Nov 17 07:16:50 .:ectospasm:.	I did too.  I would have kept using Colemak except that RDP doesn't play nice with it, and Colemak isn't a built-in layout in Windows 10.
Nov 17 07:17:09 .:ectospasm:.	The context switching between QWERTY and Colemak was too much for my brain
Nov 17 07:17:11 .:tent405:.	all of my workflow, top down, is based on what i know for key strokes.
Nov 17 07:17:34 .:tent405:.	i'm not going to rebuild that on a new typing system, no thanks.
Nov 17 07:17:38 .:wallabra:.	You think at 100wpm? I think I think at like, 120wpm. Which is still slower than I type. Which becomes a problem way too often lo
Nov 17 07:17:42 .:ectospasm:.	One day, I will not need to connect to a Windows system any longer, and I'll make the switch to Colemak then.
Nov 17 07:17:47 .:wallabra:.	Typing fast is kinda overrated, at least when it's typing in chat
Nov 17 07:17:55 .:paulguy_:.	i'm OK just knowing qwerty and йцукен. :p
Nov 17 07:18:03 .:tent405:.	thinking about how to think at wpm is an interesting idea. very psych.
Nov 17 07:18:07 .:paulguy_:.	i don't think i could fit a third

Nov 17 07:21:44 .:tent405:.	I'm too old to think and type at 120wpm. Sometimes I dream, and I dream in symbols per second, but the translation has a hard time keeping up.
Nov 17 07:22:18 .:tent405:.	I dream in my native language most of the time. When other languages get in, it's rather easy to translate them.
Nov 17 07:22:58 .:tent405:.	That's a pretty neat thing about being in a dream, the ability to quickly speak and adapt to foreign languages.
Nov 17 07:23:21 .:wallabra:.	My native language is Portuguese
Nov 17 07:23:37 .:paulguy_:.	sometimes my dreams have cyrillic gibberish

Nov 17 08:35:24 .:paulguy_:.	i wasn't particularly affected by that drama
Nov 17 08:35:56 .:paulguy_:.	i mean definitely showed the character of some people and that's important but things seemed to recover well
Nov 17 08:36:55 .:+eagle:.	ya I just didnt care enough at the time and life got busy. basically got on to reg and that was it
Nov 17 08:39:17 .:paulguy_:.	ah
Nov 17 08:39:49 .:+eagle:.	mpan still a poopy
Nov 17 08:39:51 .:+eagle:.	?
Nov 17 08:40:09 .:paulguy_:.	poopy?
Nov 17 08:52:18 .:paulguy_:.	man some gmod maps are huge.  it seems kinda a waste to download a whole GB just to check something out and not really _do_ much with it.
Nov 17 08:52:57 .:+eagle:.	thats a forever-ago topic holy shit
Nov 17 08:53:08 .:+eagle:.	well I guess I loaded up some CS surf maps the other month...
Nov 17 08:54:32 .:paulguy_:.	heh
Nov 17 08:55:07 .:paulguy_:.	i've mostly just been checking out maps in sandbox
Nov 17 08:55:59 .:+eagle:.	what sorta stuff is in those maps? crazy physics stuff? goldberg machines?
Nov 17 08:56:29 .:paulguy_:.	uhm
Nov 17 08:56:47 .:paulguy_:.	i mean yeah most have physics props but i haven't seen any goldberg machines
Nov 17 08:56:57 .:+eagle:.	that'd be cool
Nov 17 08:57:23 .:paulguy_:.	mostly just kinda, places you can be for things.  a lot of stuff is for RP, but some stuff is for other game modes.
Nov 17 08:57:40 .:paulguy_:.	lots of liminal spaces :p
Nov 17 08:58:03 .:manicennui:.	https://i.redd.it/rnw9upu1ed0a1.png
Nov 17 08:58:05 .:paulguy_:.	and russian things
Nov 17 08:58:24 .:paulguy_:.	hehe
Nov 17 09:00:02 .:bq:.	been watching a lot of gmod troll vids 
Nov 17 09:00:18 .:+eagle:.	people RP in gmod?
Nov 17 09:00:36 .:bq:.	yeah apparently
Nov 17 09:00:41 .:bq:.	they take it seriously
Nov 17 09:00:49 .:paulguy_:.	people RP in everything
Nov 17 09:00:53 .:bq:.	too much maybe
Nov 17 09:01:00 .:paulguy_:.	they just RP with whatever game they have :p
Nov 17 09:01:22 .:paulguy_:.	i'm sure it's usually fine but yeah i imagine it can be quite cringe :p
Nov 17 09:01:44 .:bq:.	oh very much so
Nov 17 09:01:46 .:paulguy_:.	but a lot of it's also like, kids and teenagers
Nov 17 09:01:51 .:paulguy_:.	which are just kinda cringe anyway
Nov 17 09:01:52 .:bq:.	yeah
Nov 17 09:01:55 .:bq:.	BubGames and dnsl are good 
Nov 17 09:02:01 .:+eagle:.	but like
Nov 17 09:02:12 .:+eagle:.	FF has RP, WoW had RP...
Nov 17 09:02:26 .:+eagle:.	gmod... "hey im a fuel cylander watch me go BRSDASDQWIHRIASD"
Nov 17 09:02:29 .:+eagle:.	?
Nov 17 09:02:36 .:paulguy_:.	i dunno about trolling people who are just having some fun though.  i could see trolling like, pay to win servers and stuff where it's people being jerks
Nov 17 09:02:39 .:bq:.	bubgames has a great catch phrase to try avoid being arrested "I have bursitis" or "I have parkinsons" 
Nov 17 09:03:01 .:+eagle:.	lol, have you ever played JAIL maps in CS?
Nov 17 09:03:11 .:+eagle:.	wardens, guards, and prisoners?
Nov 17 09:03:19 .:bq:.	PTW servers feature in the trolls' activity
Nov 17 09:03:22 .:+eagle:.	can be pretty fun.. about as close to RP ill ever get
Nov 17 09:03:33 .:bq:.	Yeah if it's a gamemode RP i can take it
Nov 17 09:03:48 .:+eagle:.	interesting
Nov 17 09:03:51 .:bq:.	but if it's just people RPing cops in a random open world it's a bit meh
Nov 17 09:04:14 .:bq:.	which seems to be what a lot of teenagers and preteens like doing in these servers
Nov 17 09:04:23 .:paulguy_:.	some of the RP maps people make are absolutely nuts though
Nov 17 09:04:26 .:bq:.	it's a little bit conxerning etc
Nov 17 09:04:46 .:paulguy_:.	there's one i found that's a town and it's basically town-sized.
Nov 17 09:05:05 .:bq:.	There are some nazi germany themed RP servers. Super toxic shit
Nov 17 09:05:13 .:paulguy_:.	yeesh
Nov 17 09:05:25 .:bq:.	of course the RPers will excuse it with "hey we are just RPing"
Nov 17 09:05:37 .:paulguy_:.	this is a as far as i can tell mostly present-day russian town, heh.
Nov 17 09:06:09 .:bq:.	but you don't join a nazi RP server to RP on it without having something wrong with you in the first place
Nov 17 09:06:23 .:paulguy_:.	i'm sure people could put Zs all over it if they wanted to but on its own it's fine heh
Nov 17 09:06:59 .:paulguy_:.	but yeah that's pretty messed up
Nov 17 09:07:44 .:bq:.	Lots of people take it super seriously too when you break RP, basically a kickable offence on some servers
Nov 17 09:09:10 .:paulguy_:.	a lot of people probably use roblox but i don't really want to support that game
Nov 17 09:09:14 .:bq:.	second life is similar with RP rabbit holes https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=57D4pJS3vuw
Nov 17 09:09:18 .:paulguy_:.	also it kinda has a crustyness i don't like
Nov 17 09:09:33 .:paulguy_:.	gmod/source is plenty crusty but it's crusty in a charming way
Nov 17 09:09:42 .:bq:.	is roblox similar to minecraft at all or just shitty graphics 
Nov 17 09:10:04 .:+mpan:.	eagle: poopy indeed
Nov 17 09:10:08 .:paulguy_:.	i think yo ucan more or less model whatever you want in roblox
Nov 17 09:10:17 .:bq:.	ah
Nov 17 09:10:21 .:paulguy_:.	but i think it's pretty limited in some ways?
Nov 17 09:10:22 .:+eagle:.	mpan: so much pewp
Nov 17 09:10:32 .:paulguy_:.	both engines use lua
Nov 17 09:10:36 .:+mpan:.	eagle: not much time to talk now, tho, as I have examinations in hospital in <2h.
Nov 17 09:10:44 .:bq:.	hope you stidied

Nov 17 09:11:24 .:+eagle:.	mpan: hows the health coming along, old man?
Nov 17 09:11:26 .:paulguy_:.	bleh was more tired earlier
Nov 17 09:14:15 .:paulguy_:.	but now i want to sleep :p
Nov 17 09:14:17 .:+dagle:.	bq: Not really. roblox is a block style world where you can define games within it.
Nov 17 09:15:31 .:paulguy_:.	it's a metaverse!
Nov 17 09:18:00 .:paulguy_:.	when i was younger i remember a newscast where the like, computer for displaying the weather was down so the weather guy had to draw the weather on paper and have the camera zoom in on it :p
Nov 17 09:28:53 .:bq:.	dagle, aha
Nov 17 09:34:11 .:+eagle:.	lol
Nov 17 09:34:22 .:+eagle:.	mpan: good luck dude
Nov 17 09:34:30 .:+eagle:.	paulguy_: was it a good drawing?
Nov 17 09:35:43 .:+mpan:.	eagle: still alive
Nov 17 09:35:51 .:+eagle:.	glad to see it
Nov 17 09:37:19 .:paulguy_:.	i don't remember specifics.  it was just like, a drawing of the pressure systems and stuff
Nov 17 09:37:39 .:+eagle:.	he must have been under a lot of pressure
Nov 17 09:37:56 .:paulguy_:.	probably heh
Nov 17 09:38:34 .:paulguy_:.	i imagine meterology school involves drawing up maps like that
Nov 17 09:39:33 .:+dagle:.	Tomorrow is that time of the year again.
Nov 17 09:39:36 .:+dagle:.	\o/

Nov 17 13:50:42 .:niki:.	There is some poor planning there because there is no fence that prevents anyone from walking on the highway from a regular road if you look on google maps, but if anything happened in that case i would say that was negligient homicide by the adults in that group

Nov 17 13:55:58 .:+mpan:.	That thing is double horror to me, as someone who was helping protecting protests/events. Aside from putting those kids at risk, the guardians are absolutely incapable of controlling the situation in any sane manner.

Nov 17 13:56:54 .:+mpan:.	I mean… sure, I confirm that it happened during our rides that a few times we ended up by a mistake in such a place with kids. But the reaction was instant, including stopping the cars until we can safely remove the kids from the road.

Nov 17 14:00:48 .:+mpan:.	niki: the bus doesn’t stop in the traffic flow, it has a separate lane for that. Also note that a speed limit doesn’t imply that it’s driver’s *right* to unconditionally drive at that speed. Most roads outside buildup areas in Poland are 80km/h, but anyone can legally stop pretty much anywhere, as well as slower vehicles may move there as well.
Nov 17 14:01:07 .:+mpan:.	niki: this is not an expressway/autobahn, which is specifically designed to carry only high-speed  traffic.

Nov 17 14:02:36 .:+mpan:.	I would also not mind the situation, if the adults were doing it on their own. The problem is that they are having other people, children in this case, under their protection.

Nov 17 14:07:16 .:+mpan:.	There was a move in urban design to avoid female trees, because they drop fruits. So some areas have only male population now, which means a lot of pollen.
Nov 17 14:07:28 .:niki:.	What
Nov 17 14:07:38 .:+mpan:.	OTOH if you only have female trees around, they also get nearly no fruits, which solves the problem. But that required some deeper thinking.

Nov 17 15:41:28 .:+mpan:.	!grab braindamage 
Nov 17 15:41:28 .:phrik:.	mpan: Tada!
Nov 17 15:41:49 .:+mpan:.	braindamage: oh, don’t get me wrong. I worked with statistics for too long to consier 1 real. :)
Nov 17 15:42:11 .:niki:.	mpan: one good way to trigger mathematicians is the definition of 'finite' every numerical physicist uses
Nov 17 15:42:22 .:+mpan:.	niki: which is?
Nov 17 15:42:24 .:niki:.	finite == larger than zero
Nov 17 15:42:28 .:+mpan:.	oh
Nov 17 15:42:48 .:niki:.	which does make some limited senes if you are thinking about it sufficiently incorrectly
Nov 17 15:42:59 .:+jelle:.	maths isn;'t real
Nov 17 15:43:34 .:niki:.	*sense
Nov 17 15:44:46 .:braindamage:.	mpan: one thing if you want to puzzle electronics people is: if white noise has infinite bandwith, and the power spectral density is constant, why doesn't everything explode because the integrated total power goes to infinite?
Nov 17 15:45:08 .:niki:.	:O
Nov 17 15:48:10 .:niki:.	That's a bit like a heat bath in thermodynamics, that does not change temperature if it exchanges heat :p

Nov 17 15:49:13 .:braindamage:.	yeah, but the part where the abstraction is idealized is a bit more hidden here
Nov 17 15:49:29 .:niki:.	what did they add to my favourite old fashioned database
Nov 17 15:49:31 .:+mpan:.	braindamage: because of “density” word. But yeah, I see how that can explode people’s brain. :)

Nov 17 15:50:00 .:+jelle:.	niki: no!
Nov 17 15:50:13 .:niki:.	This is more stuff that jelle wants in software i used to like

Nov 17 15:50:27 .:+jelle:.	niki: you donut get it
Nov 17 15:50:40 .:+jelle:.	niki: it compiles to WASM a binary javascript bytecode thingy
Nov 17 15:50:47 .:+mpan:.	braindamage: I assume it’s akin to how is it possible that any single event in a continuous distribution has probability of 0, yet they all can happen. :)
Nov 17 15:50:56 .:+jelle:.	niki: so a browser can load wasm and you can use it wth JS
Nov 17 15:50:59 .:+mpan:.	And how those 0 are not equal to each other.
Nov 17 15:50:59 .:+jelle:.	so you get sqlite in JS
Nov 17 15:51:29 .:braindamage:.	mpan: indeed, you'll be integrating it only on a finite time scale
Nov 17 15:51:44 .:braindamage:.	so the spectrum is truncated
Nov 17 15:52:48 .:niki:.	there is also always some upper frequency cutoff even in theory
Nov 17 15:53:13 .:braindamage:.	yes, it's a consequence of the modes of the quantum oscillator
Nov 17 15:53:32 .:+mpan:.	Quantum oscillator?
Nov 17 15:53:32 .:braindamage:.	the result is that the autocorrelation function is not impulsive, but gets finite width
Nov 17 15:53:44 »»	+mpan thinks this goes beyond his knowledge.
Nov 17 15:53:55 .:+mpan:.	I mean… at this point you speak Chinese to me! :D
Nov 17 15:54:03 .:braindamage:.	to analyse white noise, you take a waveguide, then suddenly close with two resistors
Nov 17 15:54:06 .:+mpan:.	Those two last sentences made literally zero sense to me.
Nov 17 15:54:17 .:+mpan:.	How suddenly? Infinitely suddenly?
Nov 17 15:54:24 .:braindamage:.	infinitely suddenly
Nov 17 15:54:43 .:braindamage:.	nyquist's argument says that whatever energy was in the waveguide is now dissipated in the resistors
Nov 17 15:54:46 .:+mpan:.	Uhh, I think Maxwell’s demon is on holiday now.
Nov 17 15:54:59 .:+dagle:.	jelle: "miss match pointer class <GaloreContext as Pointee>::Metadata == ()" D:
Nov 17 15:55:11 .:braindamage:.	and the waveguide's oscillation modes determinite the signal that the resistors see
Nov 17 15:55:12 .:+dagle:.	jelle: I have no clue what that error message even mean.
Nov 17 15:55:13 .:+mpan:.	I hired it yesterday with a problem of an unrealistic circuit. :)
Nov 17 15:55:27 .:+dagle:.	jelle: Rust is "simple".
Nov 17 15:55:32 .:braindamage:.	it's an idealization, but it gives you realistic results
Nov 17 15:56:13 .:braindamage:.	it's just a way to reconcile discontinuities in a diff eq
Nov 17 15:56:48 .:braindamage:.	anyway, if you calculate the modes and the energy in the oscillator, you get the transfered energy into the resistors, so you can calculate the energy
Nov 17 15:56:52 .:+mpan:.	The circuit in question had an LC tank consisting of *two* inductors and a capacitor, with one inductor initially having non-zero current on it, while other components did not. Obviously you need to borrow a demon from Maxwell to even consider that.
Nov 17 15:56:56 .:braindamage:.	and the "spike" is that discontinuity
Nov 17 15:57:21 .:braindamage:.	that's a valid starting condition
Nov 17 15:57:30 .:braindamage:.	it's an ideal one, but valid nonetheless
Nov 17 15:57:32 .:+mpan:.	But not in a real world circuit.
Nov 17 15:57:51 .:+mpan:.	Yes, I am pretty certain you can set any conditions you want.
Nov 17 15:59:10 .:braindamage:.	eh, I can easily design a circuit where it can approximates that
Nov 17 15:59:37 .:braindamage:.	just put a generator in parallel with the coil which shorts it, and then suddenly open
Nov 17 15:59:51 .:+mpan:.	Can you as easily calculate the initial transient? Not the steady state, as that can be calculated from LC tank equation on Wikipedia, but the initial transient. :>
Nov 17 16:00:12 .:braindamage:.	easily not, but certainly I can
Nov 17 16:00:15 .:braindamage:.	it's an ODE
Nov 17 16:00:20 .:+mpan:.	braindamage: nope, you also need to have it disconnected from the rest of the circuit. And needs to swap the switches instantly at the same instant.
Nov 17 16:00:35 .:+mpan:.	s/swap/flip
Nov 17 16:00:40 .:braindamage:.	yes, but there's such thing as sufficiently fast here
Nov 17 16:00:51 .:+mpan:.	yes, for approximation
Nov 17 16:01:07 .:braindamage:.	all circuit analysis in time domain has approximations
Nov 17 16:01:12 »»	+mpan enables evül mode and steals the capacitor. :>
Nov 17 16:01:29 .:braindamage:.	or are you going to tell me that you wait infinite time for an RC to get charged?
Nov 17 16:02:02 .:+mpan:.	braindamage: no. I am sure that it can be calculated. I am sure a few years ago I even would be able to do that. Now I am just rusty. But that was never a trivial case.
Nov 17 16:02:17 .:niki:.	mpan: i was thinking more fundamental, that we don't have any physical theory for stuff that is fast compared with the planck time
Nov 17 16:02:34 .:braindamage:.	that's a bit in nature of the plank time tho
Nov 17 16:02:45 .:niki:.	so it is 'not possible in theory' in the sense that there is no theory
Nov 17 16:02:59 .:+mpan:.	niki: well, it’s the boundary of the existing theory.
Nov 17 16:03:01 .:braindamage:.	plank units are pretty much: what if we find a scale where no effect can be neglected?
Nov 17 16:03:13 .:braindamage:.	and at that point, everything breaks
Nov 17 16:03:24 .:braindamage:.	because the theories are mutually incompatible
Nov 17 16:03:42 .:niki:.	mpan: yes but science is always only about the currently existing model, there is no deeper truth in science
Nov 17 16:03:51 .:+mpan:.	niki: BTW, I may suggest PBS Timespace if you want something about physics, which is well curated.
Nov 17 16:04:00 .:+mpan:.	niki: of course. Science is not religion.
Nov 17 16:04:51 .:niki:.	well it is a kind of nihilistic religion i guess but semantics
Nov 17 16:04:57 .:+mpan:.	The notion of absolute truth has been consequently more and more rejected since like 17th century. That was the crime of Galileo, BTW.
Nov 17 16:05:51 .:niki:.	tbh in my high school science education i got the impression that we are talking about absolute truth, which i don't like in retrospect
Nov 17 16:05:52 .:+mpan:.	Poor guy promoted the idea that a mathematical model is truth by itself. 
Nov 17 16:06:23 .:+mpan:.	niki: so did I. Prolly because no one ever cared about tearing us out of that deception. Maybe most of the teachers were not even aware.
Nov 17 16:07:17 .:niki:.	I mean Galileo Galilei basically invented science
Nov 17 16:07:34 .:niki:.	i think he gets some slack
Nov 17 16:07:43 .:braindamage:.	his dialogue is fantastic imo
Nov 17 16:07:50 .:braindamage:.	I've read it only recently
Nov 17 16:08:47 .:braindamage:.	I think it was aristotele that planted the horrible concept that you could derive the whole universe in your head, and that's a much much worse brainworm
Nov 17 16:08:55 .:+mpan:.	niki: I was only freed from that trap in my 20s, after working with statistics. It really cured me from many things.
Nov 17 16:09:06 .:niki:.	before that you basically only had natural philosophy which is more a humanity like mathematics

Nov 17 19:39:46 .:MacGyver:.	rcf: Not every legal document needs to be "accepted" in order to be in effect, such as most privacy statements.
Nov 17 19:40:24 .:niki:.	yeah i also chuckle when a website in the EU requires me to accept their privacy statement
Nov 17 19:40:27 .:niki:.	:I
Nov 17 19:40:28 .:MacGyver:.	Requiring "acceptance" of a privacy statement is an interesting and incorrect conflation of using permission as processing ground and requiring notification of everything you do.
Nov 17 19:40:50 .:MacGyver:.	In the same vein, I wonder whether you, as an *end-user*, actually need to accept the GPL.
Nov 17 19:41:08 .:niki:.	I think i can cite from the GPL 2.0 for that
Nov 17 19:41:10 .:paulguy_:.	markus persson is an ass
Nov 17 19:41:26 .:paulguy_:.	also an example of "you know someone is in mensa when..."
Nov 17 19:41:33 .:MacGyver:.	they tell you?
Nov 17 19:41:36 .:paulguy_:.	exactly :p
Nov 17 19:42:01 .:niki:.	“Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted”
Nov 17 19:42:35 .:niki:.	I always read that as "if you force end users you accept the GPL you didn't read it yourself"
Nov 17 19:42:37 .:paulguy_:.	also minecraft only got good when microsoft bought it :p
Nov 17 19:42:48 .:MacGyver:.	niki: Well by installing you *are* copying, no?
Nov 17 19:42:55 .:MacGyver:.	This is an interesting greyish legal area.
Nov 17 19:43:05 .:paulguy_:.	installing would be covered by the packager right?
Nov 17 19:43:07 .:MacGyver:.	Some types of copy are, and some aren't, "copies".
Nov 17 19:43:24 .:MacGyver:.	paulguy_: You're doing the copying.
Nov 17 19:43:44 .:niki:.	MacGyver: but is the end user doing the copying or not the distributor?
Nov 17 19:43:57 .:niki:.	the end user just receives a copy!
Nov 17 19:44:11 .:MacGyver:.	But runs the installer which does the copying!
Nov 17 19:44:19 .:MacGyver:.	(This is why it's interesting)
Nov 17 19:44:28 .:wallabra:.	what's the bottleneck in minecraft java edition? i never thought this through, i always just chalked it up to "haha hosted language bad, 'is it interpreted or compiled?' 'it's your mom' xtreme technology 2069 super fancy techbro Rich Text future of the web 3 billion devices are gay vibrators"
Nov 17 19:44:38 .:paulguy_:.	free robux setup.exe
Nov 17 19:44:45 .:wallabra:.	yea kinda
Nov 17 19:45:04 .:MacGyver:.	Still, I don't think it's strictly needed to separately *accept* the GPL for that (and thank heavens it isn't because ain't nobody got time for that when running pacstrap)
Nov 17 19:45:30 .:paulguy_:.	my understanding with the difference between java and bedrock is the cellular automata in java edition is always reproducible.
Nov 17 19:45:42 .:paulguy_:.	where bedrock edition has some randomness
Nov 17 19:45:47 .:niki:.	MacGyver: which i took as a hint that most distributors also understand it like that, i never had to accept the GPl when installing a distributions..
Nov 17 19:45:53 .:niki:.	*distribution
Nov 17 19:46:35 .:paulguy_:.	and that randomness might make it more parallelizable
Nov 17 19:46:56 .:paulguy_:.	but it really only matters for like, weird 0 tick redstone stuff
Nov 17 19:47:30 .:niki:.	we need quantum redstone now so future generations can program quantum computers :3
Nov 17 19:49:54 .:wallabra:.	for a split second I forgot black people with beards exist

Nov 17 19:54:35 .:bertptrs:.	Actually probably set by a French person since they do their punctuation that way?
Nov 17 19:54:54 .:MacGyver:.	niki: Only way to do it in a hellhole like Qatar.
Nov 17 19:54:55 .:bea:.	i dont think any weather qatar has counts as winter
