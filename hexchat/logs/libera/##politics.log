Nov 16 15:02:44 .:+dTal:.	yeah I believe I made it clear I wasn't interested in your shitty opinion meo
Nov 16 15:02:54 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: I don't mind being referred to as they or them, but I find it a little noisy in user profiles.
Nov 16 15:03:11 .:+dTal:.	Jardie: noisy how?
Nov 16 15:03:24 .:+Jardie:.	Reading the name with the pronoun on it takes longer.

Nov 16 15:03:32 .:+dTal:.	Everyone puts pronouns in their profiles, signatures etc. It's the Done Thinng.

Nov 16 15:03:43 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: it's a pretty anglocentric practice, arguably.
Nov 16 15:03:58 .:+dTal:.	uh speaking in english is anglocentric
Nov 16 15:04:01 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: I don't mind it in the user description but it's noisy if it's in the username.
Nov 16 15:04:06 .:+dTal:.	not sure what your point is
Nov 16 15:04:23 .:+Jardie:.	My point is there is cultural imperialism involved, to some extent.
Nov 16 15:04:43 .:+Nachlader:.	i had a french colleague who put "she/her" in her linkedin profile name

Nov 16 15:06:28 .:+dTal:.	I disagree that there's any cultural imperialism in putting your preferred pronouns after your name.
Nov 16 15:06:53 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: the entire practice is very bound to a specific culture.
Nov 16 15:06:54 .:+dTal:.	There's nothing coercive about it.
Nov 16 15:07:10 .:+dTal:.	Culturally boound practices are imperialistic?
Nov 16 15:07:20 .:+Jardie:.	When they are hegemonic, sure.
Nov 16 15:07:26 .:+dTal:.	That's circular.
Nov 16 15:07:31 .:+Nachlader:.	i was culturally imperialised by the US earlier this morning by listening to a john adams composition
Nov 16 15:08:48 .:+Jardie:.	Where's the circularity? When a hegemonic culture imposes its standards, even through non-coercive means, it's imperialistic.
Nov 16 15:08:53 .:+dTal:.	Anyone is free to speak whatever language they wish on the internet. There's no laws forbidding it. And anyone is free to put pronouns after their name in whatever language they wish.

Nov 16 15:09:20 .:+Jardie:.	There are affordances, ideological state apparatuses, and so on involved.
Nov 16 15:10:03 .:+dTal:.	Your position appears to be that any cultural practice that is popular is "imperialistic". I don't believe you have a meaningful point here.
Nov 16 15:10:35 .:+dTal:.	Your "argument" applies equally to every behavior.
Nov 16 15:10:41 .:+Jardie:.	No, a practice that is pushed by a hegemonic culture.
Nov 16 15:11:13 .:+dTal:.	K.
Nov 16 15:11:46 .:+Jardie:.	Practices that are bound to non-hegemonic cultures are not imperialistic if they spread, at best one could say there's appropriation involved, but there's no imperialism in spreading the practice.

Nov 16 15:20:23 .:+dTal:.	hexnewbie: well as you say you can just not put anything, so I don't think that's a useful line of enquiry
Nov 16 15:21:00 .:+dTal:.	Putting pronouns is an overt statement
Nov 16 15:22:07 .:KeKou:.	If eating bread can be a symbol of some kind, I think I can accept that any option represents a symbol.

Nov 16 15:29:24 .:+dTal:.	On the one hand, I feel it shows solidarity with nonbinary people by advocating for the abolishment of genered pronouns in general. On the other hand, it potentially dilutes the efforts of people who actually do feel strongly about what pronouns are used

Nov 16 15:29:45 .:+meo:.	my favourite podcasts quietly dropped it and i couldnt be happier
Nov 16 15:30:14 .:+dTal:.	kmh this stuff matters

Nov 16 15:30:45 .:+meo:.	they are wrong
Nov 16 15:30:51 .:+meo:.	and need to be corrected
Nov 16 15:31:04 .:+kmh:.	dTal, that's the problem you can make anything matter and turn into symbol
Nov 16 15:31:17 .:+dTal:.	it already matters and is already a symbol
Nov 16 15:31:41 .:+dTal:.	language is literally nothing but symbols
Nov 16 15:31:54 .:+kmh:.	so?
Nov 16 15:32:15 .:+dTal:.	...so it matters.
Nov 16 15:32:36 .:+kmh:.	i don't really see a problem with putting a pronoun or not putting a pronoun there
Nov 16 15:32:50 .:+dTal:.	It has real impacts on how people feel about you and about themselves.
Nov 16 15:33:08 .:+dTal:.	It's worth asking questions like I asked.
Nov 16 15:33:09 .:+macrobat:.	does it make the world better or worse, kmh?
Nov 16 15:33:13 .:+kmh:.	and the expectation that should or shouldn't is much more annoying
Nov 16 15:33:44 .:+dTal:.	"Annoying"? I'm sorry you're inconvenienced but there are much larger issues at stake
Nov 16 15:33:53 .:+kmh:.	macrobat, should/shouldn't makes the world more stupid imho (and often intolerant)
Nov 16 15:34:12 .:+meo:.	people should be able to assume pronouns from names and pictures
Nov 16 15:34:16 .:+dTal:.	I think people who get upset at the pronoun thing are already intolerant
Nov 16 15:34:38 .:+dTal:.	what's "annoying" is being forced to confront their own bigotry
Nov 16 15:34:45 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  you asked for an opinion and i gave you one
Nov 16 15:34:53 .:+meo:.	i never said im tolerant
Nov 16 15:34:59 .:+dTal:.	I asked for a woke opinion
Nov 16 15:35:13 .:+meo:.	but those are illegitimate to begin with
Nov 16 15:35:17 .:KeKou:.	kmh: Obviously, not the answer he wanted.
Nov 16 15:35:21 .:+dTal:.	if you think the whole thing is stupid, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Nov 16 15:35:32 .:KeKou:.	lol
Nov 16 15:35:45 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  the annoyance refers not to the question here, but to requiring people to put a pronoun in a profile or requiring that no pronoun is mentioned
Nov 16 15:36:04 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  that's annoying to
Nov 16 15:36:07 .:+dTal:.	There's no requirement. It's perfectly fine to put nothing and many do.
Nov 16 15:36:36 .:+meo:.	well that's like, too bad, because i'm going to express my opinion anyway
Nov 16 15:37:06 .:+kmh:.	it's kinda simple put yur pronoun there if you want and live other people and their profiles alone (and vice versa)
Nov 16 15:37:39 .:+dTal:.	I feel like you're not engaging with the question I actually asked, which queries the nature of "my pronoun"
Nov 16 15:37:48 .:+kmh:.	dTal, so what's the problem there? Anybody demanding that a pronoun can't be in your profile?
Nov 16 15:38:22 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  fine - what are you actually asking?
Nov 16 15:38:45 .:+meo:.	o/~ i can feel it coming
Nov 16 15:38:48 .:+meo:.	o/~ in the air tonight
Nov 16 15:38:52 .:+meo:.	o/~ oh lord
Nov 16 15:40:01 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  may be starting with what profile exactly you are talking about
Nov 16 15:40:36 .:+dTal:.	I am asking - is it okay to put "they/them" pronouns in my profile because I hold a political belief that gendered pronouns in general ought to be deprecated?
Nov 16 15:41:50 .:+kmh:.	dTal, as i said it is completely ok to put whatever pronoun in your profile if it is important to you and if you want to be addressed that
Nov 16 15:41:53 .:+dTal:.	Putting your pronouns is generally held to be a statement of identity, but putting your preferred pronouns when anyone could guess them is a political statement of solidarity.
Nov 16 15:42:23 .:+dTal:.	But kmh I am indiffierent if someone actually uses "they/them" to refer to me
Nov 16 15:42:37 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  well that put a solidarity statement in your profile

Nov 16 20:08:07 .:+banana_:.	me being a citizen at least, it's differnt for non-citizens on US soil
Nov 16 20:08:12 .:KeKou:.	banana_: You can say specific things, or a few things, some of which I might be against and some of which I might be for. It depends on what the issue is.
Nov 16 20:08:51 .:+banana_:.	Kekou: i thought you were defending the People's Republic of China government on here?
Nov 16 20:09:45 .:KeKou:.	banana_: My salary will not increase if China becomes the number one country in the world. So, I don't care. But I can comment on specific things.

Nov 16 20:11:08 .:KeKou:.	banana_: World number one, which may mean something in your understanding, doesn't mean much to me.
Nov 16 20:11:30 .:+banana_:.	i thought you took offense to anti-chinese government sentiment on here
Nov 16 20:12:50 .:KeKou:.	banana_: I generally ignore those people because they think that way and it's not something that can be changed by debate. Free speech, they can say that.
Nov 16 20:12:59 .:+banana_:.	oh ok interesting you don't care if even if China becomes the ultimate super power
Nov 16 20:13:42 .:suss:.	you mean to be supremacy
Nov 16 20:13:53 .:KeKou:.	banana_: Unless, of course, they must have me endorse them, and that's a different issue.
Nov 16 20:14:51 .:d_garbage:.	well hopefully people will find a better way than the rather dodgy concept of 'countries' anyway at some point
Nov 16 20:14:59 .:+banana_:.	KeKou: ok what if I rephrased, would it be bad if China became the ultimate super power?
Nov 16 20:15:38 .:KeKou:.	banana_: Usually, those arguments are, they must want me to approve their ideas, very strange. I myself usually don't get involved in their discussions, no matter what they say about China.

Nov 16 20:20:53 .:KeKou:.	banana_: My thought is that it is hard to change one's mind in a debate, so I don't want to get involved in the China debate either. It's just that some people will become angry when I say some facts about China.

Nov 16 20:25:00 .:KeKou:.	banana_: You see them saying that I defend the Chinese government, when in fact, it's me saying something else, and they always make the connection. Just ten minutes ago, I was finally considered an apologist for the Chinese government for saying that Trump was running in the presidential election. Anyway, it's such a boring thing.

Nov 16 20:31:45 .:+banana_:.	KeKou: I think it's an issue of like any imbecile could debate their view, like "the earth is flat" and keep arguing their point even though it doesnt make sense at all
Nov 16 20:32:10 .:d_garbage:.	banana_, it's the 'not making sense' part that's important
Nov 16 20:32:20 .:+banana_:.	so maybe that's where some of the motivation is coming from to squash triggering views
Nov 16 20:33:00 .:d_garbage:.	banana_, why does something someone else believe in seem not to make sense?
Nov 16 20:33:10 .:+banana_:.	d_garbage: i think there's levels of not making sense. e.g. your view could make some sense but not enough to be sound

Nov 17 06:10:48 .:+Jardie:.	And, if by unlikely mischance, he turned out to be right, he could always point it out afterwards.
Nov 17 06:11:15 .:+wroathe:.	His initial reaction was just to take the side of his team, but once contradictory evidence becomes public he'll likely change his tune to exactly what you just said
Nov 17 06:13:04 .:+wroathe:.	Also, it's like 4am in Spain. Isn't this past your bedtime?
Nov 17 06:13:45 .:KeKou:.	It is the professionalism of a leader to never say he is wrong.

Nov 17 06:17:51 .:KeKou:.	wroathe: It's just a metaphor, you don't have to rush. Here, obviously the leader everyone is talking about is the president. You may have strayed from the topic.

Nov 17 06:18:48 .:KeKou:.	wroathe: You know, people are talking about the president of Russia and the president of Ukraine?
Nov 17 06:18:55 .:+wroathe:.	Anyway, the idea that a leader can't ever admit they're wrong is just straight up moronic, no matter the scope of leadership
Nov 17 06:20:06 .:KeKou:.	wroathe: Are you still a leader? Or, would you rather stay inside the leader you think you are. What does all this have to do with Russia, Ukraine.

Nov 17 14:53:00 .:+kmh:.	de-facto,  well the motivation is similar to those of other nations, groups and a problem with military in general

Nov 17 14:54:21 .:+kmh:.	i yet have to see a military fighting "clean" in a prolonged war without resorting to torture or intentionally harming civilians
Nov 17 14:55:44 .:+kmh:.	de-facto,  and its not that russians haven't done it before to slavic brothers, just consider Stalin and Poland
Nov 17 14:56:27 .:+kmh:.	de-facto, it is not whataboutism but an explanation (for which you need the big picture)
Nov 17 14:56:45 .:+hexnewbie:.	kmh: There are still levels of that. You can torture non-civilians, or not care about civilians, or even attack civilian infrastructure like Russia currently does in the hope that the pain makes the enemy capitulate. And there's what people find in liberated places in Ukraine, which is the targetting of Ukranians on the faintest of rationale, which is worse.
Nov 17 14:56:45 .:+de-facto:.	yes it really appears to be something specific to their attitude or war doctrines. i think its probably written in some KGB or FSB manual how to do such things
Nov 17 14:57:14 .:+kmh:.	you asked why they do it and i'm saying since they all do it (in different degrees) in is an inherent problem with wars and militaries
Nov 17 14:57:30 .:+hexnewbie:.	The difference being that the former have a military reason, mostly.
Nov 17 14:57:34 .:+kmh:.	and a reason why one should avoid wars in the first place

Nov 17 14:58:31 .:+kmh:.	hexnewbie,  oh sure there differing degrees (depending how much controlling pressure comes from politics, public and military leadership)
Nov 17 14:58:44 .:gwendolen_:.	So NATO probably won't go to war over a stray missile and we don't need to panic

Nov 17 15:00:17 .:+hexnewbie:.	gwendolen_: Well, not over a stray missile that was Ukrainian for sure. Yeah, it wouldn't have even if it was Russian (unless Poland really tried pushing it, and somehow succeeded), sure
Nov 17 15:00:37 .:+de-facto:.	specifically in this instance, where Russians apparently try to not only invade and occupy but to annex territories, it seems to be especially counter productive to torture and execute civilians, but taken together with their general attitude it seems it is aligned with their genocidal approach, remove those that oppose the Russian World with violence, execution, torture and deportations into "filtration camps"
Nov 17 15:00:55 .:+hexnewbie:.	(I haven't checked news since the evening, if the missile changed nationality again, apologies)
Nov 17 15:01:13 .:+kmh:.	de-facto,  authoritarian system tend to do it more often, as athoritarian have less scruples/different morals to begin with and they often block/prevent publuc pressure or military leadership to reign it in

Nov 17 15:03:05 .:+de-facto:.	this kind of approach seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the claimed intention to "liberate" their Ukrainian Slavic brothers in the best intent for them.

Nov 17 15:18:51 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: first, it is not; look at the formulation about sovereignty; but second, putting in question a state formation is not equivalent to wanting to destroy a national group.
Nov 17 15:19:01 .:+de-facto:.	Putins twisted view on history seems to be employed by the intent to forcefully re-unite Ukraine into RUssia without their consent
Nov 17 15:19:09 .:+hexnewbie:.	Article doesn't load for me. If something supports de-facto claim in it, de-facto should quote it. But it containing claims to the contrary is immaterial (and cannot support the opposing point) -- you cannot exonerate yourself from a claim with your own words.
Nov 17 15:19:19 .:+de-facto:.	Jardie, so you say that Ukraine is not a state or nation?
Nov 17 15:19:21 .:+hexnewbie:.	(Well, baring some very special circumstances)
Nov 17 15:19:44 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: I'm not saying anything, we're analysing evidence here.
Nov 17 15:19:56 .:+Jardie:.	Your claim: this article proves intent to destroy a national group.
Nov 17 15:20:02 .:+Jardie:.	This claim is false.
Nov 17 15:20:42 .:+Jardie:.	It doesn't even contain evidence that Ukrainian sovereignty is in question, since it actually mentions Ukraine as a sovereign.
Nov 17 15:21:00 .:+hexnewbie:.	(I've seen a suspect accidentally confessing to a rape in front of the police, whose confession contained “I didn't rape her, she consented to it”, and was mostly composed of that, he just accidentally said what he meant by that.)

Nov 17 15:22:07 .:+hexnewbie:.	Oh, article loaded. I'm not reading something that long to see what de-facto means
Nov 17 15:22:26 .:+Jardie:.	Yes, I wish I hadn't had to deconstruct the pro-NATO shilling either.
Nov 17 15:22:29 .:+Jardie:.	But someone has to do it.
Nov 17 15:22:59 .:+de-facto:.	Jardie, this article reveals the RUssian attitude towards Ukraine, its giving the currently observed Russian actions in Ukraine context, taken together the intent of genocide becomes crystalclear
Nov 17 15:23:38 .:+Jardie:.	No, it doesn't. First off, because it clearly acknowledges respect for the existence of a Ukrainian national group, as I just quoted; it even acknowledges the right of existence of a Ukrainian sovereign state formation.
Nov 17 15:23:52 .:+Jardie:.	What you're claiming does not bear, and you are not making any case for it other than asserting it.

Nov 17 15:26:09 .:+Jardie:.	There's a lot of historiographical musings, some of which you can agree or disagree with; there is at no point any intent to destroy either Ukrainians as a people or Ukraine as a state.
Nov 17 15:26:29 .:+Jardie:.	Right, another secondary source. Is it hat you can't read?
Nov 17 15:26:46 .:+Jardie:.	I can give you 30 minutes if you want to read the article you linked in the first place.
Nov 17 15:26:53 .:+Jardie:.	And then we can talk about it, and not about what other people say about it.
Nov 17 15:26:59 .:+Jardie:.	Other people who happen to be NATO shills.
Nov 17 15:27:35 .:+de-facto:.	basically Putin seems to try to twist and weaponize history turning it against Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, taken together with the actions of the Russians that invaded Ukraine, them trying to erase anything Ukrainian like language, currency, culture, schools draws a pretty clear picture
Nov 17 15:28:39 .:+Jardie:.	Twist and weaponise is merely a value judgement. The article observes certain historical events and developments. It has a certain framing. It can be argued with, certainly. But it neither denies the existence of a Ukrainian national group, nor of a Ukrainian sovereign state formation.
Nov 17 15:28:44 .:+Jardie:.	Nor suggests that either should be destroyed.
Nov 17 15:28:56 .:+Jardie:.	And whenever you want to prove me wrong, quote from the article, and problem solved.
Nov 17 15:29:30 .:+de-facto:.	the very first sentence already reveals the Russian narrative "During the recent Direct Line, when I was asked about Russian-Ukrainian relations, I said that Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole." <-- this together with the RUssian choices of trying to remove Ukrainian language etc already shows the genocidal attitude
Nov 17 15:30:05 .:+de-facto:.	Ukrainians are not the same people as Russians, they have their own culture, language, identity, nationality, territory etc
Nov 17 15:30:20 .:+Jardie:.	No, it doesn't. It shows nothing of the sort.
Nov 17 15:30:53 .:+Jardie:.	You mean like the article claims? We respect the Ukrainian language and traditions. We respect Ukrainians' desire to see their country free, safe and prosperous.
Nov 17 15:31:06 .:+Jardie:.	You're agreeing with the article when you say that, not disagreeing.
Nov 17 15:32:01 .:+de-facto:.	ALso it does not make any sense to try to derive claims on territory and ruling over people from some historic developments in the past. Russia does not have any right to invade former Soviet states just because they once did do that already
Nov 17 15:32:40 .:+Jardie:.	Sure? How's that related to proving the intent element of the crime of genocide?
Nov 17 15:32:52 .:+Jardie:.	Violation of Ukrainian sovereignty is unlawful, but it is not per se genocide.
Nov 17 15:33:06 .:+de-facto:.	Jardie, "We respect the Ukrainian language and traditions. We respect Ukrainians' desire to see their country free, safe and prosperous." <-- do you actually believe such words without even questioning the intent behind them?
Nov 17 15:33:22 .:+de-facto:.	dont you think that makes you appear naive under the given context of the Russian invasion?
Nov 17 15:33:28 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: you were the one who introduced this article as evidence to prove intent.
Nov 17 15:33:31 .:+Jardie:.	I'm pointing out it doesn't do that.
Nov 17 15:33:45 .:+Jardie:.	If you didn't think this article should be used to prove intent, why the fuck did you make me waste my time reading it?
Nov 17 15:34:06 .:+Jardie:.	Like, what the fuck, am I the only person who can halfway sustain a sound argument on this?
Nov 17 15:34:08 .:+de-facto:.	my point is that this article is propaganda trying to establish context to the (back then) planed invasion and annexation of Ukraine
Nov 17 15:34:30 .:+de-facto:.	its publication was done to prepare the annexation and genocide on Ukrainians
Nov 17 15:34:44 .:plank:.	jardie around here youre one of the few who can
Nov 17 15:35:00 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: that may be true (let's stipulate to it). It's still insufficient basis to prove the subjective element of the crime of genocide, the desire to eliminate a national group.
Nov 17 15:35:53 .:+Jardie:.	There  is no evidence in this article compatible with that intent. The intent may exist, but this article doesn't prove it, or help in any way in proving it.
Nov 17 15:36:01 .:+de-facto:.	the narrative is that RUssians and Ukrainians were the same people all along and therefore its just "returning them home"
Nov 17 15:36:17 .:plank:.	thats _a_ narrative
Nov 17 15:36:23 .:+Jardie:.	The narrative is much more complicated, as I pointed out, by quoting from the actual fucking article.
Nov 17 15:36:37 .:+Jardie:.	Which you then dismiss as unimportant, though it is your own evidence.
Nov 17 15:37:05 .:+de-facto:.	thats a very twisted view on history and already back then understood to be a threat to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, something that apparently turned out to be a valid suspicion
Nov 17 15:37:52 .:plank:.	this guy loves to ignore his interlocutor when they point out hes wrong
Nov 17 15:38:01 .:plank:.	its getting old de-facto
Nov 17 15:38:07 .:+Jardie:.	Specifically: > Of course, some part of a people in the process of its development, influenced by a number of reasons and historical circumstances, can become aware of itself as a separate nation at a certain moment. How should we treat that? There is only one answer: with respect!
Nov 17 15:38:41 .:+Jardie:.	This is literally saying that even if historically there was no Ukrainian nationality, it has appeared over time.
Nov 17 15:39:49 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: for the sake of the argument, let us say that this article is dangerous to Ukrainian nationality and territorial integrity (I am stipulating to it, without necessarily agreeing). This is irrelevant to whether there is genocidal intent.
Nov 17 15:40:29 .:+de-facto:.	its not irrelevant as we already know how RUssians proceed from there
Nov 17 15:40:49 .:plank:.	we do?
Nov 17 15:40:53 .:+de-facto:.	they annex the territory and deport the inhabitants bringing in their own people instead
Nov 17 15:41:05 .:+de-facto:.	its what Russians did in Kaliningrad for example
Nov 17 15:41:41 .:+Jardie:.	What.
Nov 17 15:41:41 .:plank:.	do you have evidence of this
Nov 17 15:41:54 .:+Jardie:.	Do you know where Kaliningrad is?
Nov 17 15:42:07 .:+Jardie:.	Also.
Nov 17 15:42:19 .:+Jardie:.	Your argument is just ill-formed.
Nov 17 15:42:26 .:+Jardie:.	Let me formalise it for you so you can see the flaw.
Nov 17 15:43:10 .:+de-facto:.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union
Nov 17 15:43:12 .:+title:.	[ Population transfer in the Soviet Union - Wikipedia ]
Nov 17 15:44:02 .:+Jardie:.	"Article demonstrates intent to violate Ukrainian territorial integrity and sovereignty. The conduct of the war resulted in deportation and replacement with Russian people instead. This makes it so the article is evidence for genocidal intent."
Nov 17 15:44:09 .:+Jardie:.	Now there are at least three problems with this:
Nov 17 15:44:28 .:+Jardie:.	1) the article doesn't say anything about the deportation and replacement of population, there is no such evidence in the article.
Nov 17 15:44:39 .:+Jardie:.	2) deportation and replacement is ethnic cleansing, not genocide.
Nov 17 15:45:20 .:+dTal:.	why even bother arguing with Mr. "Stalin did nothing wrong"
Nov 17 15:45:26 .:+dTal:.	(real quote)
Nov 17 15:45:26 .:+Jardie:.	3) there is no evidence, even if #1 and #2 were granted, that the conduct is intended to destroy a national group.
Nov 17 15:45:47 .:plank:.	dtal because you support the ethos of liberal democracy? idk man
Nov 17 15:46:03 .:+Jardie:.	Yes, there was population transfer in the Soviet Union, which is also not evidence for your claim, since, get this, the Soviet Union no longer exists.
Nov 17 15:46:36 .:plank:.	because being wrong about one thing has no bearing on one's correctness on other issues?
Nov 17 15:47:33 .:+dTal:.	plank: I'm sorry, I'm not following. Does the "ethos of liberal democracy" require us to entertain discussion with people who so clearly operate in a spirit of wilful contrarianism?
Nov 17 15:47:47 .:+de-facto:.	if deportation is done with the intent do destroy the national identity of Ukraine (which seems to be the case in Ukraine, how can it be a crime to hold up the Ukrainian flag?) then its genocide as in "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such"
Nov 17 15:48:08 .:+de-facto:.	Jardie i am still waiting for you to make any point
Nov 17 15:48:25 .:+de-facto:.	i have linked you many articles by now and you still seem to be unable to make any point on them
Nov 17 15:48:42 .:plank:.	dtal yes
Nov 17 15:48:52 .:plank:.	i suppose you arent following
Nov 17 15:49:05 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: wrong on two counts. First off, it isn't because the objective elements of the crime of genocide are contained on article 2 of the convention, and genocide is not as broad as to cover ethnic cleansing. Second, even if we stipulate to it, the article contains no suggestion of this intent at all.
Nov 17 15:49:10 .:+dTal:.	It's a kind of flat-earther-ism - contradicting the mainstream narrative to make oneself feel special. The more outrageous the contradiction, the more special they feel. Do you argue with flat earthers?

Nov 17 15:49:20 .:rosalind:.	:)
Nov 17 15:49:43 .:plank:.	if we dont argue with flat-earthers, or make other efforts to correct them, then guess what?
Nov 17 15:49:47 .:plank:.	they vote for people like trump
Nov 17 15:50:09 .:+dTal:.	Have you tried arguing with Trump voters? They are also beyond help.
Nov 17 15:50:14 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: I don't see how I'm being contrarian about this particular issue. It's not my fault that de-facto's evidence is weak in this instance.
Nov 17 15:50:21 .:plank:.	enjoy your descent into fascism i guess
Nov 17 15:50:32 .:+Jardie:.	One could make a halfway decent claim that .ru is committing genocide in .ua but de-facto isn't making it.
Nov 17 15:50:34 .:plank:.	at least youll have the pleasure of being right while doing nothing about it
Nov 17 15:50:37 .:+dTal:.	And plank, with Jardie it's all the same issue. The issue is "anything that makes Russia look good"
Nov 17 15:50:45 .:plank:.	on this you are wrong
Nov 17 15:50:51 .:plank:.	the issue is "anything that makes the US look bad"
Nov 17 15:51:23 .:+hexnewbie:.	Um, how many here have argued with a flat earther? I know I haven't. And I don't think it's possible. The flat earther rationale is immunized against any external reasons; after all, it has had to go against all of it to adopt their current position.
Nov 17 15:51:38 .:+dTal:.	Exactly.
Nov 17 15:51:50 .:+dTal:.	It's absolutely pointless.
Nov 17 15:52:11 .:plank:.	yes, democracy is a bit pointless
Nov 17 15:52:27 .:plank:.	easier to implement democratic centralism
Nov 17 15:52:33 .:plank:.	glad we're in agreement
Nov 17 15:52:41 .:+dTal:.	Erm, no.
Nov 17 15:52:47 .:+Jardie:.	This is a very interesting ad hominem excursus, but the fact is the article linked contains no basis to sustain a genocidal intent, and anyone who disagrees has the article in hand and can show me the opposite very easily.
Nov 17 15:52:52 .:+kmh:.	hexnewbie,  I recommend Edwin Abbot's Flatland
Nov 17 15:53:23 .:+Jardie:.	I'm still waiting.
Nov 17 15:53:31 .:plank:.	if youre arguing that arguing with certain people who are part of your democratic system is pointless, youre arguing against democracy
Nov 17 15:53:48 .:+de-facto:.	Jardie, again the article from Kremlin gives the context for the plans that back then were made to invade Ukraine. together with the actions we see now implemented against the Ukrainain people this clearly is genocidal as i pointed out above the article transports the narrative of "returning home" the "little Russians" to the "big Russians" (as claiming them to be one people).
Nov 17 15:53:49 .:+de-facto:.	"In essence, Ukraine's ruling circles decided to justify their country's independence through the denial of its past, however, except for border issues. They began to mythologize and rewrite history, edit out everything that united us, and refer to the period when Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union as an occupation. "
Nov 17 15:53:54 .:+Jardie:.	plank: one could even bring forth Habermas' notion of communicative rationality.
Nov 17 15:54:28 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  you don't win over flatearthers (or almost nanybody else for that matter) with single arguments
Nov 17 15:54:30 .:+dTal:.	Jardie: the current position of the Russian oligarchy is very publically that Ukraine does not exist culturally as a separate entity of Russia, that it "should not" exist as a sovereign country, and they are currently shelling the capital and deporting and murdering people. I don't know what else you need.
Nov 17 15:54:53 .:+Jardie:.	de-facto: that's a historical assessment you can disagree with, if you like. How does it show intent to destroy a national group though?
Nov 17 15:55:02 .:+dTal:.	It's as clear cut a case as any, short of leveling the country with nukes.
Nov 17 15:55:17 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  instead its a long time consuming process being a mix of arguments, policies, actions (which benefit them as well)
Nov 17 15:55:43 .:+kmh:.	dTal, and the process takes years or decades
Nov 17 15:55:47 .:+dTal:.	You do win people over with single argument. Sane, rational people.
Nov 17 15:55:57 .:plank:.	lol
Nov 17 15:56:06 .:+dTal:.	It's people who have made their beliefs into an identity that you can't talk to.
Nov 17 15:56:08 .:+Jardie:.	dTal: you need some form of evidence like you had whenever genocide was actually proven, for example, Rwanda, of an intent to destroy a national group, rather than the intent to annex territory or, however misguidedly, reunify two peoples.
Nov 17 15:56:23 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  that why why you grassroots movements and that's what it takes to maintain a democracy
Nov 17 15:56:36 .:+Jardie:.	Note that I'm not saying the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty is lawful, I have never said this. But there's a big distance from illegal war to genocide and we haven't seen good evidence to cross that distance.
Nov 17 15:57:16 .:+kmh:.	resorting to "basket of deplorables" (hopeless) approach for larger groups will make your democracy sooner or later unworkable
Nov 17 15:58:00 .:+kmh:.	it probably will end up slowly descending into a fascistoid hellhole
Nov 17 15:58:19 .:+dTal:.	Jardie: evidence like all the russian leadership repeatedly saying Ukraine isn't a real country and is not culturally or ethnically distinct from russia
Nov 17 15:58:26 .:+dTal:.	repeatedly, over and over
Nov 17 15:58:30 .:+dTal:.	you keep ignoring that
Nov 17 15:58:35 .:+kmh:.	dTal,  no you don't and there is no such thing as completely rational person anyhow
Nov 17 15:58:44 .:+Jardie:.	No, I don't keep ignoring that because that's not evidence towards the intent to destroy a national group.
Nov 17 15:58:53 .:+dTal:.	Yes, it is.
Nov 17 15:58:56 .:+Jardie:.	That's evidence towards intent to annex.
Nov 17 15:59:02 .:+Jardie:.	Which is bad in itself, but different.
Nov 17 15:59:35 .:+dTal:.	No, it's clearly the intent to destroy a culture.
Nov 17 15:59:44 .:+Jardie:.	Destroying a culture is not genocidal per se.
Nov 17 15:59:49 .:+dTal:.	Expressly and explicitly.
Nov 17 16:00:03 .:+dTal:.	You would assert 2+2=5 if it aligned with your biases.
Nov 17 16:00:06 .:+Jardie:.	You need to destroy actual persons or their reproductive capacity, per article 2 of the convention.
Nov 17 16:00:36 .:+Jardie:.	Incidentally, I wasn't the one to introduce the convention's definition, either.
Nov 17 16:00:52 .:+de-facto:.	"There may be an argument: if you are talking about a single large nation, a triune nation, then what difference does it make who people consider themselves to be – Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. I completely agree with this. Especially since the determination of nationality, particularly in mixed families, is the right of every individual, free to make his or her own choice. "
Nov 17 16:00:55 .:+kmh:.	Jardie,  wasn't the term extended to culture?
Nov 17 16:01:35 .:+de-facto:.	again implying that it makes no difference if people claim to be Russian, Belarussian or Ukrainian.
Nov 17 16:01:46 .:+Jardie:.	kmh: not in the convention. There's a borderline case I guess of giving children of a group in adoption to members of another group, but the basis for that seems to rather be the lack of biological continuity afterwards. And in any case, the article that was quoted by de-facto doesn't suggest intent to do this anywhere.
Nov 17 16:01:53 .:+kmh:.	Jardie,  meaning eradicating cultural identity (rather physical and reproduction elimination)
Nov 17 16:02:06 .:+dTal:.	Is this a conversation about definitions?
Nov 17 16:02:09 .:+Jardie:.	kmh: no, some people use genocide a wee bit more broadly like that but it is not codified anywhere.
Nov 17 16:02:18 .:+de-facto:.	taken together with the invasive Russian aggression and nullifying cultural and national identity of the suppressed this reveals the intent to suppress the national and cultural differences with military force
Nov 17 16:02:19 .:+dTal:.	If so then I am no longer interested.

Nov 17 16:11:38 .:+xeno:.	Jardie: I'm the opposite; PDF's have at least a well defined rendering and can be viewed on an ebook reader, tablet or similar - or printed with the same rendering. HTML is just a giant train crash that is right now mainly designed for and used for flashy mashups of crap
Nov 17 16:12:01 .:+kmh:.	Jardie,  sure that's why i personally don't use it that way, but the wording of the arguably covers such cases

Nov 17 16:13:37 .:+xeno:.	Jardie: I see that problem too, and I'm definitely not in favour of the way PDF's are just a bunch of random boxes of stuff with coordinates - so it all depends on what dysfunction has the greatest impact on different people

Nov 17 16:22:37 .:+hexnewbie:.	Jardie: My authentication claim was a joke. My meaning was only the authentic sources are stuck in a bubble where PDF is an acceptable format. (Full disclosure: I'm an exception to that, I use PDF too)
Nov 17 16:23:27 .:+hexnewbie:.	“PDF? OK, that clearly came from a government!”
Nov 17 16:24:41 .:+xeno:.	also, you have PDF/A that ensures that the display of it is reproduceable and system independent
Nov 17 16:25:32 .:+Jardie:.	Sure, but the text is the series of tokens, not the display of tokens.
Nov 17 16:25:33 .:+xeno:.	and it also has an accessibility standard where the content is accessible as a stream of characters
Nov 17 16:25:46 .:+Jardie:.	Yes and the accessibility standard is shite and nobody implements it correctly.

Nov 17 16:26:11 .:+Jardie:.	Well, Office does an almost decent job of it.
Nov 17 16:26:17 .:+Jardie:.	But for example latex is tragically bad.
Nov 17 16:26:26 .:+Jardie:.	Writer is meh.
Nov 17 16:26:48 .:+xeno:.	latex is a typesetting / rendering language, so not suitable at all for character streams . Similar with PostScript
Nov 17 16:26:50 .:+Jardie:.	hexnewbie: do you use cmap?
Nov 17 16:27:24 .:+hexnewbie:.	Jardie: I'm not, and I don't believe it's even supported in LuaLaTeX
Nov 17 16:27:52 .:+hexnewbie:.	I quote often read PDFs with midnight commander and don't even bother with opening them in a GUI. Especially when I'm searching for strings in my stash as opposed to reading.
Nov 17 16:28:00 .:+xeno:.	one advantage with PDF/A over HTML, is that since PDF/A is reproduceable and system independent, if someone signs it you can say they signed it. With HTML you would have to reproduce their computer with their exact browser version and shit to be able to say what they signed

Nov 17 16:29:32 .:+hexnewbie:.	Jardie: My PDFs turn into plain text quite nicely, except for the headers (which I added a month ago), and the drop initials which add an extra space there: “M ary didn't know what she had gotten herself into”
Nov 17 16:31:15 .:+xeno:.	hexnewbie: it's because [M] [ary] are two different text boxes, and then only way you can know they belong together (outside of UU tags), is by the closeness of the coordinates

Nov 17 16:35:04 .:+Jardie:.	I haven't done latex in a while and don't know what the new hot things are.
Nov 17 16:35:43 .:+xeno:.	what I meant was that the rendering will differ based on browser and OS. It's like, the user view it with IE7 , and a paragraph is missing, because that font was styled to use Lucida-Sans-Unicode, and IE7 couldn't display that font and left blanks instead or something... or it stacked two tables differently so it looked like the paragraph belonged together with something else..  so then the signer could come and say "It didn't look like that for me, if it had
Nov 17 16:35:43 .:+xeno:.	 I would never have signed it!" - and then what do you do?
Nov 17 16:36:46 .:+hexnewbie:.	I don't know what that is. I'm mostly doing plain text files format like it was customary for typesetting in my family when I was 4, and currently using Python + LuaLaTeX to automatically turn them into PDFs.

Nov 17 17:32:02 .:+hexnewbie:.	It should be more correctly to say that it uses wordpress as a vector, the malware can be pretty platform-agnostic as long as PHP execution is involved;.
Nov 17 17:32:43 .:gwendolen_:.	There are lots of cyber attacks now days. Cyber security experts will be in high demand now.
Nov 17 17:33:17 .:gwendolen_:.	I assume
Nov 17 17:33:36 .:+hexnewbie:.	Bitcoin miners don't even require PHP, they use Wordpress to launch a Perl script that never dies and downloads/relaunches itself, so the infection is a server process (that if killed is resurrected through the original vulnerability)

Nov 17 17:40:54 .:+hexnewbie:.	kmh: Yes. XDebug <=2.5.5 (Debian 9 or earlier) allows debugging by default. Any client can tell the server “I'm phpStorm and I'm debugging, connect to me on this port so I can send you debug commands”, and feed it any PHP commands which it executes
Nov 17 17:42:16 .:+hexnewbie:.	You just need to install it and have one PHP script (of any kind) that is publicly accessible. I think that's required, though I'm not sure. Also, xdebug is the only way to profile PHP scripts. So if your site is slow, you have to install it.

Nov 17 19:21:22 .:+catties:.	bernard__: thx
Nov 17 19:21:33 .:SymbioticFemale:.	hexnewbie: it took me like 5 mins to do that so i don't feel bad
Nov 17 19:21:46 .:+catties:.	SymbioticFemale: stop that or i'll ban you
Nov 17 19:21:47 .:KeKou:.	catties: Use DeepL, Those who have used it know.
Nov 17 19:21:57 .:SymbioticFemale:.	i suffered like 10x longer to make that sentence than it takes for text to speech to read it
Nov 17 19:21:58 .:+hexnewbie:.	catties: I feel for you. If someone asks me for verbal assessment of other people's performance, and I have to do so frankly, they'll have to fire more people than Elon did. 😃
Nov 17 19:22:44 .:SymbioticFemale:.	catties: i had a friend in college who cited yelp reviews as references on his graduation thesis. needless to say we didn't go to the same college but we both graduated
Nov 17 19:23:23 .:SymbioticFemale:.	one of my best male friends irl actually
Nov 17 19:23:47 .:+catties:.	SymbioticFemale: sorry, specifically the unicode homoglyphs nonsense
Nov 17 19:24:01 .:KeKou:.	There's a bit of irony, isn't there? A programmer can't have software write his reports for him.
Nov 17 19:24:22 .:SymbioticFemale:.	catties: ok sorry i'll keep it to ascii art in the future
Nov 17 19:24:45 .:SymbioticFemale:.	misgendering catties is an art that KeKou excels at
Nov 17 19:24:55 .:+catties:.	hmm
Nov 17 19:25:00 .:+catties:.	nbsp is a homoglyph for space
Nov 17 19:25:48 .:KeKou:.	SymbioticFemale: I use "him".

Nov 17 19:26:02 .:bernard__:.	why do you call that glyph homo tho
Nov 17 19:26:05 .:+catties:.	hexnewbie: i have to write performance reviews for my reports :/

Nov 17 19:27:44 .:SymbioticFemale:.	here is a bunch of performance reviews that you can use as templates
Nov 17 19:27:51 .:+Jardie:.	Also it's not a homoglyph because nbsp is, as its name indicates, non-breaking.
Nov 17 19:28:18 .:+catties:.	Jardie: SymbioticFemale typed some nonsense text that was full of homoglyphs earlier
Nov 17 19:28:23 .:bernard__:.	t'was a joke
Nov 17 19:28:26 .:+catties:.	Jardie: that your TTS presumably failed miserably on
Nov 17 19:28:32 .:+Jardie:.	Oh, it most definitely did.
Nov 17 19:28:35 .:+hexnewbie:.	Jardie: I think the shape of non-breaking space will be the same of the breaking one (albeit I find an odd strange term to use for any kind of spaces) “In orthography and typography, a homoglyph is one of two or more graphemes, characters, or glyphs with shapes that appear identical or very similar”
Nov 17 19:28:44 .:SymbioticFemale:.	Jardie: catties is willing to ban me to compensate you for any suffering that may have occured
Nov 17 19:28:54 .:KeKou:.	Maybe we should start a company that helps employees write reports on their companies. Hire a few nerds from the university.
Nov 17 19:28:55 .:+Jardie:.	hexnewbie: most of the time the non-breaking space will not look like anything at all, no?
Nov 17 19:29:10 .:+catties:.	looking like nothing appears similar to also looking like nothing
Nov 17 19:29:10 .:+catties:.	:P
Nov 17 19:29:11 .:czarbomba:.	catties should just !addquote <SymbioticFemale> i think my brain is broken.
Nov 17 19:29:31 .:SymbioticFemale:.	i'm glad you lack voice czarbomba because thats a partial quote
Nov 17 19:29:33 .:+Jardie:.	catties: alright, but looking like nothing is different from looking like a few blank pixels.
Nov 17 19:30:16 .:SymbioticFemale:.	KeKou: its easier to just plagarize performance reviews
Nov 17 19:30:45 .:+catties:.	Jardie: yeah but i don't want to warn people for using "homoglyphs and nbsp" when "homoglyphs" will suffice
Nov 17 19:31:14 .:+Jardie:.	Mmm, fair.
Nov 17 19:31:15 .:+hexnewbie:.	Jardie: Non-breaking space looks exactly like a space, except paragraph is not broken up into multiple lines at that point, hence it's considered a letter for the purposes of wrapping. You're conflicting it with zero-width space (those have non-breaking and breaking varieties, and also a soft hyphen, which is an altogether different thing as it gets replaced with a dash when a word is broken up th
Nov 17 19:31:19 .:+hexnewbie:.	there)
Nov 17 19:31:21 .:KeKou:.	SymbioticFemale: Aha, you like the Chinese way.
Nov 17 19:31:31 .:SymbioticFemale:.	catties: there are some free "AI" essay writers. they're free for a limited amount of words. you give them a prompt and it turns your few words or couple sentences into a paragraph
Nov 17 19:31:45 .:+Jardie:.	I thought non-breaking space was the one often used to indicate hyphenation, but yes, that's the soft hyphen I suppose.
Nov 17 19:31:45 .:SymbioticFemale:.	catties: its what all the cool kids use now to graduate from places
Nov 17 19:32:01 .:+catties:.	SymbioticFemale: dude, there are novelists who are using AI generated paragraphs
Nov 17 19:32:12 .:SymbioticFemale:.	i can believe that
Nov 17 19:32:47 .:+Jardie:.	In that case I was wrong, and nbsp is indeed homoglyphic.
Nov 17 19:32:57 .:+hexnewbie:.	Why would they do that? I simply plagiarise books whose copyright has expired. Particularly for stuff that sounds anachronistic, so if someone argues about me on it, I can link to the book I plagiarised.
Nov 17 19:33:12 .:+hexnewbie:.	with me

The bill, which ostensibly protects children from harmful content, could result in widespread censorship of sex work and LGBTQ content. https://t.co/mZEhFvgO2Y" / Twitter ]
Nov 17 19:33:33 .:+Jardie:.	Not sure how to feel about this, the sex work part is good but the queer part is bad?
Nov 17 19:33:40 .:SymbioticFemale:.	hexnewbie: plagarizing something that has expired copyright gives you old info and might still have you run afowl of acedemic honesty requirements
Nov 17 19:34:15 .:KeKou:.	If you write a novel with AI, even if the writing sucks, there will be a lot of people buying it.
Nov 17 19:34:22 .:+hexnewbie:.	SymbioticFemale: Hey, I was told I cannot even plagiarise my own works
Nov 17 19:34:26 .:SymbioticFemale:.	i presume wikipedia isn't copyrighted, yet copy-and-pasting from there is still considered plagarism / acedemic dishonsty

Nov 17 19:41:22 .:+hexnewbie:.	Um, that doesn't sound like a thing you get away with. It sounds like the thing an oil company sends to you to court for.
Nov 17 19:41:39 .:+hexnewbie:.	And you *wish* you had plagiarised something public.

Nov 17 19:44:28 .:czarbomba:.	she has to get a running start
Nov 17 19:45:17 .:+hexnewbie:.	When I plagiarise things, I usually alter everything I disagree with to the point it's unrecognizable. Once we were given a silly highschool essay. I downloaded one from the internet because I was stumped to write anything, fixed what I didn't like, and teacher praised me as the only one in the class who hadn't plagiarised the same essay (everyone else had submitted the one I had found, verbatim)
