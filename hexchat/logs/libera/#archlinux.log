Nov 14 00:47:05 .:ESphynx:.	OK seems I might have them already, might have been confused with my GCC prefixes..

Nov 14 14:33:40 .:jenia2:.	ohh I see. it's just a text file I need to edit

Nov 14 14:40:59 .:jenia2:.	!
Nov 14 14:41:01 .:grawity:.	for that matter you can remove the / entry from fstab

Nov 15 16:53:28 .:zeewark1:.	hello out there, if I enabled multilib, there should be a 32bit version of all libs I have on the 64bit side? but in my case I don't have a libudev.so in the lib32 dir

Nov 15 16:54:20 .:jelle:.	mostly, enough for wine/steam
Nov 15 16:54:21 .:mpan:.	zeewark1: multilib only contains 32b libs that are needed by some programs.

Nov 15 17:09:40 .:zeewark1:.	question: these 32bit libraries, are they real working libraries or just proxys which defer the requests to the 64bit version of that lib?

Nov 15 17:10:30 .:predicament:.	I have a question about an AUR helper that says it's out of date, and it isn't out of date.  Can someone unmark that crap?  I hate seeing it.
Nov 15 17:11:18 .:astralc:.	predicament: the aur package maintainer need to mark it 'in date'
Nov 15 17:11:31 .:predicament:.	is it possible that they'd allow me to do that?
Nov 15 17:11:40 .:predicament:.	or a way for me to just have it not appear as out of date
Nov 15 17:12:01 .:astralc:.	if it paru? it mark because crybabies don't know how to rebuild packages
Nov 15 17:12:04 .:predicament:.	remember it's not pacman
Nov 15 17:12:10 .:predicament:.	yeah paru.
Nov 15 17:12:51 .:predicament:.	I know this isn't usually AUR but I'm also asking about my system here so I think it might be a valid question.
Nov 15 17:13:05 .:astralc:.	check paru docs?
Nov 15 17:13:20 .:predicament:.	i did, i didnt *see* anything overt
Nov 15 17:13:54 .:astralc:.	ignore that, or move to paru-bin for now
Nov 15 17:14:00 .:predicament:.	i never ask without looking for at least 5 pieces of documentation OR arch wiki
Nov 15 17:14:03 .:predicament:.	oh yeah
Nov 15 17:14:09 .:predicament:.	i forgot about paru-bin
Nov 15 17:14:17 .:predicament:.	and yeah how would i ignore it though
Nov 15 17:14:22 .:predicament:.	in pacman.conf:?
Nov 15 17:14:39 .:astralc:.	no, just, "ah yeah, OK, moving on"
Nov 15 17:14:50 .:predicament:.	oh that kind of ignore
Nov 15 17:14:57 .:predicament:.	i thought you meant ignore the package
Nov 15 17:15:02 .:predicament:.	somehow.
Nov 15 17:15:21 .:predicament:.	i have been ignoring for like a month now
Nov 15 17:15:37 .:Scimmia:.	predicament: but it *is* out of date...
Nov 15 17:15:50 .:predicament:.	oh then i wanna rebuild with a new PKGBUILD
Nov 15 17:15:57 .:predicament:.	right?
Nov 15 17:16:22 .:predicament:.	and if that's correct, how is it out of date?  everyone is saying it is not
Nov 15 17:16:32 .:predicament:.	and two people said it is
Nov 15 17:16:50 .:predicament:.	you and someone on the AUR comment section.
Nov 15 17:17:07 .:predicament:.	so i'm definitely a little curious how it's out of date
Nov 15 17:17:14 .:Scimmia:.	check upstream
Nov 15 17:17:29 .:predicament:.	i dont have time to check too many things
Nov 15 17:17:32 .:predicament:.	so hang on
Nov 15 17:17:35 .:predicament:.	might take a second
Nov 15 17:17:45 .:Khorne:.	uninstall the package, solved
Nov 15 17:17:50 .:predicament:.	no, not solved
Nov 15 17:18:06 .:Khorne:.	Very much solved, no package, no problems
Nov 15 17:18:06 .:predicament:.	i love paru
Nov 15 17:18:08 .:Khorne:.	!next
Nov 15 17:18:08 .:phrik:.	Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
Nov 15 17:18:11 .:predicament:.	oh shut up
Nov 15 17:18:12 .:predicament:.	Jesus.
Nov 15 17:18:13 .:predicament:.	lol
Nov 15 17:18:25 .:predicament:.	the package is something i need sir
Nov 15 17:18:31 .:MacGyver:.	I'm with Khorne, software was a mistake.
Nov 15 17:18:36 .:predicament:.	think so?
Nov 15 17:18:52 .:predicament:.	hm
Nov 15 17:18:56 .:MacGyver:.	All tech problems of the last 20 years? Software.
Nov 15 17:19:05 .:predicament:.	oh thats what you think i mean
Nov 15 17:19:07 .:predicament:.	no
Nov 15 17:19:15 .:predicament:.	but yeah thats true
Nov 15 17:19:25 .:Khorne:.	I don't get the problem even, the package is out of date and you are being told about it
Nov 15 17:19:27 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	predicament, you aren't posting the exact error
Nov 15 17:19:32 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Post the output
Nov 15 17:19:32 .:Khorne:.	If you dont want that feature, use different software
Nov 15 17:19:37 .:predicament:.	theres no error, it just says "marked out of date"
Nov 15 17:19:42 .:astralc:.	move to paru bin, problem sovled
Nov 15 17:19:44 .:Khorne:.	Because it is, and correctly so
Nov 15 17:19:46 .:astralc:.	solved
Nov 15 17:19:55 .:predicament:.	i have a question
Nov 15 17:19:55 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	So... there isn't problem then
Nov 15 17:20:00 .:predicament:.	which version
Nov 15 17:20:05 .:Khorne:.	1.11.2
Nov 15 17:20:08 .:MacGyver:.	predicament: The PKGBUILD for Paru is still on 1.11.1, whereas upstream has released 1.11.2. That's what out-of-date means.
Nov 15 17:20:08 .:predicament:.	THANK YOU
Nov 15 17:20:16 .:predicament:.	thank you guys.
Nov 15 17:20:19 .:predicament:.	thats what i wanted.
Nov 15 17:20:19 .:Khorne:.	Sorry you are unable to read
Nov 15 17:20:29 .:predicament:.	you might be the one that can't read
Nov 15 17:20:32 .:predicament:.	scroll up a bit.
Nov 15 17:20:33 .:Khorne:.	I know that must make life difficult, I didn't intend to be so harsh on you
Nov 15 17:20:34 .:Scimmia:.	of course, 1.11.2 was just a rebuilt for openssl. Why upstream would call that a release, though...
Nov 15 17:20:35 .:predicament:.	I said i don't hav emuch time
Nov 15 17:20:42 .:predicament:.	and that it might take a minute,
Nov 15 17:20:48 .:predicament:.	because i was reading about it.
Nov 15 17:20:51 .:predicament:.	lol
Nov 15 17:20:52 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Scimmia, lol, just a release for that? Seriously?
Nov 15 17:20:54 .:Scimmia:.	predicament: yet you waste time complaining about the most minor thing imaginable
Nov 15 17:20:55 .:Khorne:.	It's ok, we are inclusive
Nov 15 17:21:05 .:predicament:.	okay im done talking then
Nov 15 17:21:20 .:predicament:.	its not complaining, it was a question
Nov 15 17:21:25 .:predicament:.	people turn it into complaining.
Nov 15 17:21:30 .:MacGyver:.	Scimmia: Possibly because that's the only way to force a rebuild in paru? :P
Nov 15 17:21:44 .:MacGyver:.	(I wouldn't know, never used paru)
Nov 15 17:21:49 .:predicament:.	okay well
Nov 15 17:21:53 .:Khorne:.	MacGyver, because AUR users don't know how software dependencies work
Nov 15 17:21:54 .:predicament:.	id o.
Nov 15 17:21:59 .:predicament:.	okay lol
Nov 15 17:22:03 .:predicament:.	oh my God.
Nov 15 17:22:10 .:predicament:.	you're funny
Nov 15 17:22:24 .:predicament:.	it's just convenience and that is ALL
Nov 15 17:22:50 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Khorne, I think that MacGyver is talking about the rebuilds of the binaries they provide in their repo
Nov 15 17:23:01 .:predicament:.	i know how to do it manually i just would rather let the AUR helper, i do not have time to do all of that with four boxes
Nov 15 17:23:09 .:Ennea:.	whenever the topic in here is AUR helpers, it always feels like their sole existence is a mistake
Nov 15 17:23:19 .:predicament:.	wow
Nov 15 17:23:22 .:predicament:.	nice.
Nov 15 17:23:26 .:predicament:.	that was a pretty good insult
Nov 15 17:23:28 .:Khorne:.	Edu4rdSHL, and I'm taking about the jib of 'upstream release to force openssl rebuild'
Nov 15 17:23:31 .:Khorne:.	talking*
Nov 15 17:23:34 .:Ennea:.	that wasn't even an insult. are you an AUR helper?
Nov 15 17:23:34 .:astralc:.	predicament:  saw users say "paru crash, I can't update my system", so....
Nov 15 17:23:40 .:MacGyver:.	Yeah, I'm guessing it has to do something with the -bin package; they could've just done 1.11.1-2 for a dep rebuild.
Nov 15 17:23:48 .:predicament:.	it just needed a rebuild astralc 
Nov 15 17:23:54 .:predicament:.	thats all.
Nov 15 17:24:00 .:Foxboron:.	Scimmia: Morgan builds binary packages and people use those. And well, users are users
Nov 15 17:24:11 .:predicament:.	but i use pacman more
Nov 15 17:24:21 .:predicament:.	so.. whatever i mean you can judge all you want
Nov 15 17:24:22 .:Scimmia:.	Foxboron: that doesn't explain a new tagged release for a simple rebuild
Nov 15 17:24:28 .:astralc:.	predicament: yes, but those users don't know how to update with just pacman...
Nov 15 17:24:30 .:MacGyver:.	predicament: We're not judging you *personally*.
Nov 15 17:24:36 .:predicament:.	i would hope not
Nov 15 17:24:38 .:astralc:.	and git + makepkg
Nov 15 17:24:49 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	!aurctl
Nov 15 17:24:49 .:Foxboron:.	Scimmia: People don't understand the rebuild. It's easier to do that release than spending hours on end answering emails about why paru is broken
Nov 15 17:24:50 .:phrik:.	aurctl() { git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/$1; }
Nov 15 17:24:52 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	:p
Nov 15 17:24:59 .:Foxboron:.	Namarrgon: Please :c
Nov 15 17:25:06 .:Scimmia:.	Foxboron: pkgrel 2, dont
Nov 15 17:25:07 .:predicament:.	oh nice
Nov 15 17:25:08 .:Scimmia:.	done
Nov 15 17:25:09 .:predicament:.	holy shit
Nov 15 17:25:12 .:predicament:.	thats cool
Nov 15 17:25:15 .:predicament:.	i didnt even think of that
Nov 15 17:25:16 .:Foxboron:.	Scimmia: this doesn't work for the binary release
Nov 15 17:25:21 .:MacGyver:.	predicament: Pretty much everyone here likely uses some kind of AUR helper, whether it be their own chewing-gum-and-duct-tape scripts or something else, nobody likes manual rebuilding.
Nov 15 17:25:26 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Scimmia, the problem is with -bin packages which download already compiled bianries from GH
Nov 15 17:25:34 .:predicament:.	yeah i figured
Nov 15 17:25:39 .:Scimmia:.	Foxboron: sure it does, upstream rebuilds it
Nov 15 17:25:52 .:Foxboron:.	Scimmia: I don't think you want to understand how users engage with this. Thats fine
Nov 15 17:25:58 .:Scimmia:.	I do
Nov 15 17:26:09 .:MacGyver:.	Scimmia: But then it would download 1.11.1 compiled against *new* openssl even on systems with *old* openssl.
Nov 15 17:26:15 .:predicament:.	sorry everyone for the confusion, i'm going back and forth between four computers right now, two are things i cant even mention lol
Nov 15 17:26:16 .:Scimmia:.	It has nothing to do with the users, it's how upstream chose to handle it
Nov 15 17:26:19 .:predicament:.	fucking annoying NDAs
Nov 15 17:26:44 .:Foxboron:.	Scimmia: Have you every managed software with a couple hunded users pestering you?
Nov 15 17:26:51 .:predicament:.	and there's two things i can't mention*
Nov 15 17:26:52 .:Scimmia:.	MacGyver: which is what it does now, anyway, that's how -bin packages work
Nov 15 17:26:58 .:Scimmia:.	yes
Nov 15 17:27:28 .:Foxboron:.	Okay, I don't want to know how you dealt with users :p
Nov 15 17:27:40 .:predicament:.	alright let me put it in the PKGBUILD And manually rebuild with the new version

Nov 15 23:24:40 .:Arsimael:.	if I pass any other sink to mpv, it shows up in pavucontrol
Nov 15 23:25:13 .:cedb:.	can you paste some journald action 
Nov 15 23:25:58 .:sim590:.	I had a functionning system, but I did change the /etc/default/grub file and now GRUB doesn't load. I'm on a live iso image (usb stick) and I'm trying to fix this. Don't know what's wrong. All I changed was the default menu entry.
Nov 15 23:26:00 .:bluetail:.	Guimauve that didnt help me
Nov 15 23:26:15 .:bluetail:.	on m1 arch, I just dont get any audio device, no matter if external or not
Nov 15 23:26:17 .:Arsimael:.	cedb, what do you need?
Nov 15 23:26:46 .:jelle:.	bluetail: archlinuxarm is not supported here, or better said asahi linux
Nov 15 23:27:04 .:bluetail:.	ah ok
Nov 15 23:27:11 .:cedb:.	Arsimael: journalctl --user -u  {pipewire,pulseaudio} ?
Nov 15 23:27:29 .:bluetail:.	but this is off-topic, so it doesnt mater
Nov 15 23:27:36 .:jelle:.	bluetail: it is not offtopic
Nov 15 23:27:43 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - i have an audio issue where it only works if i have headphones plugged in. same chipset, everything unmuted. laptop so nothing is unplugged. i've given up figuring it out. see if your headphones work just in case. 
Nov 15 23:27:54 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	sim590, revert the change :p
Nov 15 23:27:55 .:cedb:.	Guimauve: yes
Nov 15 23:28:14 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	And run grub-mkconfig (I think that you need that)
Nov 15 23:28:23 .:bluetail:.	I have no audio at all on the m1 with arch at the moment
Nov 15 23:28:50 .:bluetail:.	but if I understood right, I am not allowed to post archlinuxarm logs here
Nov 15 23:29:00 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Not logs, not request support
Nov 15 23:29:06 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	ARM is simply not supported
Nov 15 23:29:15 .:sim590:.	Edu4rdSHL: I was running linux 5.15-lts. I wanted to go on regular version of linux.
Nov 15 23:29:33 .:Arsimael:.	cedb, All I get are some weird messages from the future :D
Nov 15 23:29:39 .:jelle:.	bluetail: ask the excellent asahi community, they know (if you don't run manjaro instead)
Nov 15 23:29:42 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	And what did you changed? Installing the kernel and running mkconfig should be sufficient
Nov 15 23:29:46 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	As far as I know
Nov 15 23:29:48 .:sim590:.	I tried disabling the automatic menu entry and timeout=0 options. But grub doesn't even appear

Nov 15 23:30:07 .:Koragg:.	I am using plymouth and when I boot up, my vendor logo does not show up with it.

Nov 15 23:38:23 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	I can't help you more, sorry... grub is still a mess and I have many years without using it :(
Nov 15 23:38:33 .:sim590:.	:(
Nov 15 23:38:50 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	My recommendation is: revert the changes, run  `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
Nov 15 23:38:50 .:sim590:.	Thanks anyway. Hope someone knows this here. I'm lost as to why it doesn't load.
Nov 15 23:39:05 .:sim590:.	I will try
Nov 15 23:39:05 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	That should get things back to how they were before
Nov 15 23:40:23 .:sim590:.	Doesn't work :(
Nov 15 23:42:11 .:sim590:.	I think the thing is that I didn't boot in the proper version of arhclinux (with uefi)
Nov 15 23:42:16 .:sim590:.	Maybe ?
Nov 15 23:44:10 .:sim590:.	Nope. I don't think so. I double checked an I selected the one that says UEFI...
Nov 15 23:44:27 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	What doesn't work?
Nov 15 23:44:56 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	The command I propossed I meant to be run on the installed OS after chrooting into it
Nov 15 23:45:16 .:sim590:.	When I reboot, my usual boot option doesn't load GRUB and I'm put back in the BIOS.
Nov 15 23:45:29 .:sim590:.	Edu4rdSHL: Yes, I'm chrooted in 
Nov 15 23:46:19 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	And you already checked the BIOS boot order?
Nov 15 23:48:03 .:sim590:.	It was fine before, so I don't know why it wouldn't be fine now. Plus, I tried to override manually and I get back in the BIOS after selecting the proper partition.
Nov 15 23:48:54 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	#grub is an option tho
Nov 15 23:51:02 .:sim590:.	OK. I'll try there.
Nov 15 23:52:17 .:Koragg:.	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/silent_boot#Retaining_or_disabling_the_vendor_logo_from_BIOS <--- this mentions "GRUB in the standard configuration blanks the screen" (of the vendor image), how would I alter said standard configuration to see my vendor image on bootup with grub?
Nov 15 23:52:18 .:phrik:.	Title: Silent boot - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 15 23:53:38 .:sim590:.	Here are the steps I did: https://i.imgur.com/OghZaZr.jpg
Nov 15 23:58:37 .:sim590:.	Should I try to reinstall grub ?
Nov 16 00:01:43 .:sim590:.	OK, I did just that and now GRUB loads up, but I get in the rescue mode with error message "symbol `grub_debug_malloc' not found.
Nov 16 00:09:38 .:Arsimael:.	wow... killing pipewire fixed mpv and everything else
Nov 16 00:09:43 .:Arsimael:.	nice
Nov 16 00:26:44 .:sim590:.	So, in the end, the issue with the GRUB error was that I didn't pass the right parameter to `grub-install` as to the `--efi-directory` flag. Now, it's fixed. But it's weird that I had to make a `grub-install` in order to fix things and that my first `grub-mkconfig` just put me in that situation...

Nov 16 13:02:45 .:chowbok:.	Why is friendica not in the AUR
Nov 16 13:03:48 .:mpan:.	chowbok: because neither you nor anyone else maintains it in there.
Nov 16 13:03:52 .:raster-:.	no one cared/bothered enough to make an aur pkg for it yet?
Nov 16 13:04:33 .:chowbok:.	Yeah, I could've guessed that, actually.
Nov 16 13:04:37 .:chowbok:.	Just griping
Nov 16 13:06:10 .:Ennea:.	time to step up and do it yourself ;)
Nov 16 13:07:31 .:chowbok:.	I might
Nov 16 13:08:16 .:chowbok:.	I'm already maintaining six AUR packages
Nov 16 13:08:32 .:raster-:.	graduate to 7. the larch.
Nov 16 13:18:41 .:AmR:.	Hello
Nov 16 13:21:48 .:coruja:.	!give AmR welcome
Nov 16 13:21:49 .:phrik:.	AmR: Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
Nov 16 13:22:18 .:AmR:.	I fix it.
Nov 16 13:24:29 .:coruja:.	boring ;)
Nov 16 13:42:32 .:zeewark1:.	what is the difference between mkarchroot and pacstrap? they both create a chroot environment and they both install packages within these chroots?
Nov 16 13:43:09 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	No
Nov 16 13:43:14 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	I mean, yes
Nov 16 13:43:20 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	But not exactly in the same way
Nov 16 13:43:35 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Both install packages, but pacstrap doesn't create a chroot
Nov 16 13:44:16 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	pacstrap just install the packages whatever you want and nothing else, mkarchroot set up a arch chroot with all the needed packages, in pacstrap you need to pass which packages do you want to install
Nov 16 13:44:57 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	Can you set up a chroot with pacstrap? yes, but you need to pass all the packages. mkarchroot does that automatically for you
Nov 16 13:45:55 .:mpan:.	I would also say that, while they may share some features, their purpose is different.
Nov 16 13:48:10 .:Tom^:.	aha so thats why, fsck required manual intervention and i hit this https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/70408
Nov 16 13:48:11 .:phrik:.	Title: FS#70408 : [mkinitcpio] Add hook for unlocking root account (at bugs.archlinux.org)
Nov 16 13:48:15 .:Tom^:.	hence i had to boot the archiso
Nov 16 13:48:18 .:Tom^:.	>.<
Nov 16 13:48:19 .:mpan:.	pacstrap’s goal is to just put files where they belong. mkarchroot’s goal is to set up an entire usable chroot, which you can instantly use (e.g. to build in clean chroot).
Nov 16 13:49:08 .:zeewark1:.	okay, I see. In my case I want to have a chroot, in which I can create a whole filesystem, which is turned into a cpio archive. so not only build one package, but a lot of them 
Nov 16 13:49:59 .:zeewark1:.	includeing AUR packages (also 32bit AUR-packages) which have to been build, which requires more build dependencies
Nov 16 13:50:05 .:Ennea:.	Tom^, interesting insight, thanks
Nov 16 13:50:14 .:mpan:.	Also correct me, if I am wrong, but I think pacstra can work over existing filesystem, while mkarchroot assumes it has a blank directory to work with.
Nov 16 13:50:27 .:zeewark1:.	and I don't want to install all these packages in my productive system
Nov 16 13:50:56 .:mpan:.	zeewark1: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot
Nov 16 13:50:57 .:phrik:.	Title: DeveloperWiki:Building in a clean chroot - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 16 13:51:30 .:mpan:.	That is mostly to avoid packages from being polluted by your current system’s configuration. Suits what you want to do, if I understand your needs correctly.
Nov 16 13:51:42 .:zeewark1:.	something like libeudev cannot get installed with libsystemd etc...
Nov 16 13:52:10 .:mpan:.	But, of course, that also prevents your current system from being affected by the build process.
Nov 16 13:52:42 .:zeewark1:.	mpan: exactly
Nov 16 13:53:24 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	mpan, thanks for clarifying what I wanted to say. :D
Nov 16 13:54:17 .:zeewark1:.	thank you guys for so long. I think mkarchroot will do it for my outer chroot, to build the inner cpio archive mybe its pacstrap ;-)
Nov 16 13:55:36 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	zeewark1, take a look to mkosi, that will helps you exactly with what you want =)
Nov 16 13:57:33 .:zeewark1:.	Edu4rdSHL: looks also interseting
Nov 16 13:58:08 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	You can create whatever you want with this, add additional files, additional packages, additional config, etc, etc :)
Nov 16 13:58:52 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	https://github.com/nspawn/mkosi-definitions/tree/master/ArchLinux/archlinux for example
Nov 16 14:37:10 .:Fr0stBit:.	Hello! Has anybody noticed a slight change in Github's fonts today? I'm not sure if its a Github update or a system update I did
Nov 16 14:37:51 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	What's exactly the change you're seeing?
Nov 16 14:40:15 .:mpan:.	If you can see old look by reverting an update, it’s the update. Otherwise one can’t tell: you do not have control over the GitHub app — it’s downloaded and run in your browser. So it’s whatever GH decides to serve you for a particular request.
Nov 16 14:41:08 .:mpan:.	Firefox has just been updated, so that may be a factor.
Nov 16 14:41:23 .:mpan:.	(if you use it)
Nov 16 14:45:11 .:Fr0stBit:.	I cannot really explain the change, I can actually feel it by looking at it
Nov 16 14:46:09 .:solsTiCe:.	yes. not sure, but it seems, it does not use the default font.
Nov 16 15:08:15 .:Fr0stBit:.	I noticed something strange! I went to Arch Wiki and inspected a paragraph font in Chromium. The font-family css attribute is set to 'sans-serif' and Chromium reports rendered font as 'Arial' but `fc-match sans-serif` reports "Noto Sans"
Nov 16 15:09:24 .:Fr0stBit:.	I suppose that GH had its main font set as 'sans-serif' before and now it explicitly set it to 'Noto Sans'
Nov 16 15:48:19 .:VinnySauce:.	morning all - stuck in data recovery hell
Nov 16 15:48:38 .:VinnySauce:.	I'm using ddrescue to try to image an old 20GB IDE drive using a USB to IDE adapter
Nov 16 15:48:46 .:VinnySauce:.	it gets about 16% through, then stops
Nov 16 15:49:02 .:VinnySauce:.	checking dmesg I get this: "INFO: task usb-storage:1040 blocked for more than 245 seconds."
Nov 16 15:49:21 .:VinnySauce:.	it seems like it's encountering a bad sector then giving up immediately and blocking the drive
Nov 16 15:49:22 .:VinnySauce:.	any ideas?
Nov 16 15:50:37 .:mpan:.	If you are using an USB adapter, I *suspect* that the adapter handles the I/O internally and presents you a virtual view of the data as USB Mass Storage device. Which means if it chockes on IDE side, the USB adapter will not be able to handle that.
Nov 16 15:50:54 .:Ingar:.	data recovery over USB adapter is hit and miss
Nov 16 15:51:11 .:Ingar:.	I usually advise against it, if possible
Nov 16 15:51:18 .:mpan:.	That should work quite ok if it’s only about some bad sectors, but if that’s a more serious issue, it may simply refuse to work.
Nov 16 15:51:20 .:VinnySauce:.	here's the dmesg log: http://ix.io/4g1K
Nov 16 15:51:40 .:VinnySauce:.	mpan Ingar I agree, that's probably what's happening
Nov 16 15:51:57 .:VinnySauce:.	I guess it's a lottery depending on the chip in the adapter as to how friendly it's gonna be to me?
Nov 16 15:52:27 .:Ingar:.	VinnySauce:  yeah, I was in a similar situation with a SATA drive last year, in the end I hooked it up to real sata because the USB adapter kept choking
Nov 16 15:52:29 .:mpan:.	Other than using an actual IDE connector, I have no other advice. Maybe someone else will have.
Nov 16 15:52:31 .:VinnySauce:.	most "idealised" scenario I suppose is an old PC I can use with an IDE controller built-in?
Nov 16 15:53:00 .:Ennea:.	are there any exotic extension cards perhaps? IDE via pci or something? ;p
Nov 16 15:53:22 .:Ennea:.	well, those might suffer from the same problem as your usb adapter..
Nov 16 15:53:29 .:mpan:.	Yes, there are IDE cards for PCI and PCI-E, should work.
Nov 16 15:53:48 .:mpan:.	(assuming they will be visible to the OS as an actual drive)
Nov 16 15:54:04 .:Ennea:.	oh, for real? sweet
Nov 16 15:54:30 .:Ingar:.	no guarantees though
Nov 16 15:54:39 .:Ingar:.	even over a native connector a drive can still choke
Nov 16 15:54:41 .:mpan:.	Note the assumption. Nothing prevents the manufacturer from making the card present itself as an USB hub. :)
Nov 16 15:54:54 .:Ingar:.	(protip, you caun run ddrescue in resverse order ;) )
Nov 16 15:54:59 .:Ennea:.	mpan, good call
Nov 16 15:55:02 .:mpan:.	Ingar: yeah, but it will choke on particular sectors and ddrescue is designed to skip over that.
Nov 16 15:55:10 .:Ennea:.	Ingar, oh, i think i saw that tip on the wiki
Nov 16 15:55:21 .:Ingar:.	mpan: that disk I was referring to actually locked itself up :D
Nov 16 15:55:29 .:mpan:.	oh
Nov 16 15:55:38 .:mpan:.	Then indeed ddrescue will be helpless.
Nov 16 15:55:47 .:VinnySauce:.	I think ddrescue should work with the parameters I've given it, but the adapter itself just panics when the drive doesn't behave as expected
Nov 16 15:55:57 .:VinnySauce:.	it's the interface that's the problem
Nov 16 15:56:00 .:Ingar:.	mpan: I guestimated what portions of the disk for ddrescue to skip, that worked
Nov 16 15:56:14 .:VinnySauce:.	I suppose I could try reverse mode
Nov 16 15:56:25 .:VinnySauce:.	if there's just a few bad sectors at the start of the disk, maybe the good stuff is at the end
Nov 16 15:57:03 .:Ingar:.	there are quite a few tricks you can pull with ddrescue, especially if you start messing with the map file
Nov 16 15:57:10 .:mpan:.	I think ddrescue also has some way to set starting offset (dd_rescue certainly does).

Nov 16 16:21:39 .:woland:.	MrElendig: I pointed make at protoMakefile 
Nov 16 16:21:42 .:woland:.	that did it
Nov 16 16:27:57 .:VinnySauce:.	ok, using ddrescue I was able to skip the bad sector, I have most of the drive including the end which I think is where the important partition stuff is
Nov 16 16:28:13 .:VinnySauce:.	I'm gonna try to mount the img now in Windows so I can run a chkdsk on it
Nov 16 16:31:58 .:Ennea:.	good luck!\
Nov 16 16:34:05 .:zeewark1:.	is there a neat method to create a user within a chroot env made by mkarchroot? Its just for building packages with makepkg 
Nov 16 16:52:25 .:lolok:.	zeewark1 are you thinking of using build tools as install tools? that would be a pretty cool hack, probably not impossible but a challenge maybe
Nov 16 17:13:03 .:mpan:.	VinnySauce: did it work?
Nov 16 17:13:28 .:VinnySauce:.	mpan good timing! I was able to use TestDisk under Windows to read the disk image, and it found an NTFS partition
Nov 16 17:13:36 .:VinnySauce:.	I was able to list the files in the partition and copy them off safely
Nov 16 17:13:42 .:VinnySauce:.	looks like a lot of data is there!
Nov 16 17:13:53 .:mpan:.	\o/
Nov 16 17:14:07 .:VinnySauce:.	so the files are safe. I'm still struggling to actually /fix/ the image so it can be directly mounted on Windows though
Nov 16 17:16:02 .:mpan:.	VinnySauce: what was the exact command you used, if you still have it in history?
Nov 16 17:18:03 .:VinnySauce:.	mpan it was example 3 from here: https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Examples
Nov 16 17:18:05 .:phrik:.	Title: GNU ddrescue Manual (at www.gnu.org)
Nov 16 17:18:15 .:VinnySauce:.	but I didn't do the reverse
Nov 16 17:18:44 .:VinnySauce:.	in the dmesg error message when the drive encounted a problem, it gave the sector that it panicked at
Nov 16 17:19:22 .:VinnySauce:.	so I converted that into bytes, and added like 500 MB, and continued with that offset
Nov 16 17:19:22 .:mpan:.	VinnySauce: I know what is the manual, but I want to put that in the wiki and want to double check my idea is right.
Nov 16 17:19:52 .:mpan:.	Did you use -i on a fresh output file? Or did you use -i to overwrite existing file?
Nov 16 17:19:57 .:amosbird:.	Hello! I remember there is a description string of resolution which looks like :  "1920hx1080w+30"  but I cannot remember what it is and how it looks like
Nov 16 17:20:01 .:VinnySauce:.	overwrite existing mpan
Nov 16 17:20:03 .:mpan:.	ok
Nov 16 17:20:09 .:mpan:.	Thanks
Nov 16 17:20:24 .:VinnySauce:.	I think the offset ensures that you don't overwrite the existing data in the img
Nov 16 17:20:31 .:VinnySauce:.	so I was writing to a .img file, not another drive
Nov 16 17:20:42 .:VinnySauce:.	but for ddrescue that doesn't matter
Nov 16 17:21:26 .:VinnySauce:.	testdisk is really what saved me because it could see the NTFS partition inside the .img
Nov 16 17:24:19 .:mpan:.	Yep, it seems so.
Nov 16 17:28:27 .:VinnySauce:.	mpan I've managed to go even further! You can use testdisk to create a .img from any partition that it finds
Nov 16 17:28:57 .:VinnySauce:.	So I did that, then mounted the .img using ImDisk under Windows, and it works - I can access it like a native disk now
Nov 16 17:29:12 .:VinnySauce:.	so I'm running chkdsk on the drive
Nov 16 17:29:21 .:Hylden:.	For some reason -- after a package update -- whenever I finish a task, I heard this droplet noise. Know which package added it in?
Nov 16 17:29:28 .:VinnySauce:.	this way I end up with a clean .img that I can image onto a USB stick or something

Nov 16 17:42:46 .:cyphertite:.	amosbird:  from the running system in question, what does `xrandr` show?
Nov 16 17:49:10 .:analoq:.	im trying to securely delete a hdd. How do i find the correct blocksize for dd ?
Nov 16 17:49:47 .:analoq:.	google says 4kb with emulation (512). Does that mean 4096 is the correct value to pass to dd?
Nov 16 17:49:51 .:grawity:.	no
Nov 16 17:50:15 .:grawity:.	dd blocksize doesn't really need to correspond to the disk sector
Nov 16 17:50:39 .:analoq:.	i thought it would be fastest that way :/
Nov 16 17:50:48 .:analoq:.	But i guess you are right, thats what the cache is for
Nov 16 17:51:00 .:grawity:.	as the /dev/sd* devices are buffered, it's fine *and much faster* if dd is told to read e.g. 256 or 1024 sectors all at once
Nov 16 17:51:07 .:grawity:.	that's one kernel call for read and one for write
Nov 16 17:51:26 .:grawity:.	while if you use bs=512, then it takes 256 calls to read 256 sectors
Nov 16 17:51:31 .:analoq:.	so as long as bs= is reasonably large, it shouldnt matter?
Nov 16 17:51:45 .:grawity:.	reasonably large and preferably a power of two (and a multiple of sector size)
Nov 16 17:51:50 .:grawity:.	so like bs=1M or bs=16M
Nov 16 17:52:01 .:analoq:.	sounds good
Nov 16 17:54:14 .:cyphertite:.	analoq:  nah, that is ^correct, but you may also want to read the cryptsetup FAQs, first, and I do mean even if your spinning rust is not encrypted :)  https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/blob/main/FAQ.md

Nov 16 18:42:03 .:zeewark1:.	they are both in conflict with systemd and its component because eudev is the udev of open-rc
Nov 16 18:42:36 .:zeewark1:.	a nimble replacement for systemd, another init Daemon
Nov 16 18:42:48 .:jelle:.	zeewark1: then the answer is to write your own PKGBUILD

Nov 16 18:43:28 .:zeewark1:.	that's a lot to do
Nov 16 18:43:40 .:jelle:.	zeewark1: not really, you can take the udev PKGBUILD as example

Nov 16 21:56:33 .:BrainDamage:.	pacstrap uses pacman
Nov 16 21:56:36 .:roxlu:.	teraflops: you mean I should boot with a archiso/usb and then just run `pacman -Syu` ? how would it know where/what to install?

Nov 16 22:03:47 .:Scimmia:.	It really is crazy how many people have been doing partial updates. Hopefully they learn from this.
Nov 16 22:04:45 .:roxlu:.	just to be sure ... I've got a `boot` and `root` partion; Do I mount them as if I would normally do when using `arch-chroot` but instead of doing the `arch-chroot` I use `pacman -Syyu -root /mnt/` ?

Nov 17 04:10:12 .:Scimmia:.	Sure
Nov 17 04:12:01 .:Fergorn:.	i have a few more questions for arch. are packages signed now by default? do i need to do extra steps to check package signatures on install?
Nov 17 04:12:31 .:Fergorn:.	how frequent are circular dependencies and breakage when upgrading the system with pacman (without aur)?
Nov 17 04:12:55 .:jb1277976:.	Saw this in my feed today https://imgur.com/a/woy7CqA
Nov 17 04:12:55 .:phrik:.	Title: WTF? - Album on Imgur (at imgur.com)
Nov 17 04:14:26 .:Namarrgon:.	Fergorn: circular dependencies are generally not a big problem on a binary distro
Nov 17 04:15:02 .:Fergorn:.	Namarrgon i remember old days when pacman broke everything on my system, because of dependency hell
Nov 17 04:15:12 .:Fergorn:.	didn't know exactly how to resolve it
Nov 17 04:15:15 .:Namarrgon:.	i don't remember that from the old days
Nov 17 04:15:36 .:Fergorn:.	when did you start using arch?
Nov 17 04:15:46 .:Namarrgon:.	'08 or so
Nov 17 04:15:50 .:Fergorn:.	me too
Nov 17 04:16:14 .:Fergorn:.	arround 2009 there was an issue and broke the system for many people
Nov 17 04:16:21 .:Namarrgon:.	which one?
Nov 17 04:16:41 .:Fergorn:.	i can't remember, it was something with circular dependencies on some libraries
Nov 17 04:16:50 .:Fergorn:.	which i didnt know how to resolve then
Nov 17 04:18:00 .:Fergorn:.	if upgrading the system with pacman is more reliable now i can give it a try again
Nov 17 04:18:13 .:Fergorn:.	how often do you suggest full system upgrade to avoid issues?
Nov 17 04:18:28 .:chown:.	based
Nov 17 04:18:32 .:chown:.	I got tor setup
Nov 17 04:18:32 .:Namarrgon:.	weekly? the longer you wait the harder it gets
Nov 17 04:18:42 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: Define "issues".
Nov 17 04:18:59 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: Anything requiring an upgrade before date X is usually announced through the news.
Nov 17 04:19:00 .:Fergorn:.	MacGyver something that will need manual intervention and pacman cant resolve
Nov 17 04:19:12 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: And usually months in advance.
Nov 17 04:19:30 .:Fergorn:.	you mean the news on the arch website? never read those
Nov 17 04:19:41 .:MacGyver:.	Well there's (part of) your problem.
Nov 17 04:19:47 .:Namarrgon:.	that would explain breakage
Nov 17 04:20:12 .:Fergorn:.	any plans to implement a news item list like portage does on gentoo?
Nov 17 04:20:24 .:MacGyver:.	There's a pacman wrapper in the repos that does that iirc.
Nov 17 04:20:31 .:Fergorn:.	ok will try it
Nov 17 04:20:51 .:Namarrgon:.	pacmatic does but you can just subscribe to the arch-announce ML as well and get the news delivered
Nov 17 04:21:33 .:Fergorn:.	i prefer a tool to read the news (especially if the tool is smart and can see which news apply to my packages installed)
Nov 17 04:21:42 .:Fergorn:.	and not fetch everything
Nov 17 04:22:18 .:Namarrgon:.	i don't think that pacmatic filters the news to you, there's not enough metadata in the announcements
Nov 17 04:22:34 .:MacGyver:.	And honestly "filtering the news" is really... not that useful.
Nov 17 04:22:56 .:MacGyver:.	On average there's one item a month, if that.
Nov 17 04:23:01 .:Fergorn:.	also i see in newer archiso editons there is a bash installer script. should i use that or go the old fashioned way
Nov 17 04:23:06 .:Namarrgon:.	it's expected that you stay on top of things and don't fly blind
Nov 17 04:23:24 .:Namarrgon:.	the 'archinstall' script? it's python, not bash
Nov 17 04:23:29 .:MacGyver:.	pacmatic *does* check the mailing lists for hist on the packages you've got, apparently.
Nov 17 04:23:31 .:Namarrgon:.	no, you should not use that
Nov 17 04:24:37 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: The archinstall stuff is mostly a programmable python library for automated installation that *happens* to have a default configuration.
Nov 17 04:24:57 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: This ain't your first rodeo, it's probably going to be more trouble than it's worth for you.
Nov 17 04:25:32 .:Fergorn:.	also about the initramfs tool that arch wrote. do i need to have a ramdisk if i dont use encryption or non standard filesystems?
Nov 17 04:25:55 .:Namarrgon:.	yes, you need one for the arch kernels
Nov 17 04:25:59 .:Fergorn:.	and if so am i suggested to use the arch tool for ramdisks or can i use the redhat one without issues?
Nov 17 04:26:16 .:Namarrgon:.	you could use dracut but i wouldn't recommend it
Nov 17 04:27:07 .:MacGyver:.	I *think* there's a way of not having a separate initcpio but instead putting it in the kernel?
Nov 17 04:27:25 .:MacGyver:.	But you get to keep the pieces.
Nov 17 04:27:34 .:Namarrgon:.	you can merge "unify" them but that still requires you to build the initramfs
Nov 17 04:27:39 .:Namarrgon:.	s/merge//
Nov 17 04:28:04 .:Fergorn:.	haven't used a ramdisk in years because i built custom kernels with what i required to boot builtin
Nov 17 04:28:17 .:Fergorn:.	so i have to remember how to do it
Nov 17 04:29:30 .:Guimauve:.	holy snausages, arch still uses svn
Nov 17 04:29:55 .:Fergorn:.	also is there a point in using btrfs or zfs in a single ssd install on a laptop?
Nov 17 04:29:59 .:Guimauve:.	good for them. i guess. 
Nov 17 04:30:23 .:Namarrgon:.	Fergorn: sure, snapshots are still nice to have
Nov 17 04:30:23 .:Fergorn:.	or i run the danger of more writes on the ssd wtih marginal benefit?
Nov 17 04:30:30 .:Namarrgon:.	don't worry about the ssd
Nov 17 04:30:51 .:MacGyver:.	You run the danger of much benefit for marginally more writes.
Nov 17 04:31:01 .:Namarrgon:.	scary
Nov 17 04:31:06 .:MacGyver:.	(Says the guy still on an lvm/ext4 stack)
Nov 17 04:31:28 .:Fergorn:.	you save the snapshots remotely right?
Nov 17 04:31:50 .:Fergorn:.	not much experience with those filesystems, thinking of trying them
Nov 17 04:31:53 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - if you want to use multiple mountpoints but not specify a specific amount of disk for each, it's nice. or if you use multiple virtual machines or containers, so that you can have them all share disk space thanks to btrfs being CoW. 
Nov 17 04:32:15 .:Namarrgon:.	Fergorn: you don't have to, snapshots are useful even if not used for backups
Nov 17 04:33:06 .:Fergorn:.	Guimauve the container thing actually sounds good
Nov 17 04:33:54 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - it is. snapshot a base install into new directories for each VM/container, and until they change those files they will all point to the same actual data on disk. 
Nov 17 04:35:00 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - you could have a hundred containers running and only use marginally more disk space than one if all they have is a few configuration changes and the app you have containerized
Nov 17 04:35:14 .:Fergorn:.	if i want better throughtput ext4 is still faster though right?
Nov 17 04:35:32 .:Guimauve:.	probably
Nov 17 04:35:44 .:Namarrgon:.	probably but on an ssd it's not a big problem
Nov 17 04:36:14 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - or XFS, which might be better if that's really your primary concern
Nov 17 04:37:10 .:Fergorn:.	also do i need to setup ssd trim manually? (usually did it with cron.weekly) and is there a custom kernel that has zfs support on arch?
Nov 17 04:38:09 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - i don't know about zfs, but i saw a link to a ZFS on root instruction on the arch wiki somewhere, so there's better info for you there
Nov 17 04:38:40 .:Fergorn:.	i read zfsonlinux is the same quality as on freebsd
Nov 17 04:38:43 .:Namarrgon:.	arch doesn't support zfs but there are aur packages and third-party repos, still wouldn't recommend it for /
Nov 17 04:38:50 .:Namarrgon:.	you have to set up fstrim yourself
Nov 17 04:38:51 .:Fergorn:.	they just dont include it in the sources because of legal reasons
Nov 17 04:39:51 .:Namarrgon:.	most of these question could have been answered by a look in the wiki, btw
Nov 17 04:39:57 .:Guimauve:.	btrfs is much better supported on linux, and you have distros like suse that use it by default
Nov 17 04:40:53 .:Guimauve:.	Namarrgon - you're only going to get facts on the wiki though, not opinions. :)
Nov 17 04:40:58 .:Fergorn:.	Guimauve its used more out of the box on some distros, but i thought zfsonlinux works  without issues now
Nov 17 04:41:22 .:Fergorn:.	maybe not so much tested as fewer people use it i guess
Nov 17 04:41:46 .:Namarrgon:.	zol always plays catch-up with the kernel, it's not free of issues
Nov 17 04:41:46 .:MacGyver:.	Fergorn: You'll want to enable fstrim.timer
Nov 17 04:41:57 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - if you want zfs, you'll probably be happier using freebsd. 
Nov 17 04:42:04 .:Guimauve:.	honestly
Nov 17 04:42:44 .:Fergorn:.	just wanted to give it a shot, dont have any specific use case for zfs. thought of using freebsd also for a try, but i wont have things like docker
Nov 17 04:43:03 .:Fergorn:.	or dotnet for development or pipewire or whatever
Nov 17 04:43:57 .:Guimauve:.	freebsd isn't bad. and the whole thing is built with clang, which i think is neat. as far as i know, neither glibc nor the kernel will currently build with clang (clarification: not ALL of the kernel, even if you manage to build your personal config)
Nov 17 04:44:31 .:Fergorn:.	some people on gentoo did build the kernel with clang i think but its generally unsupported
Nov 17 04:45:27 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - back on topic though, i'd suggest btrfs over zfs for linux
Nov 17 04:45:54 .:Fergorn:.	ok i see will give it a shot. might also use a tool suse has for the snapshots or something similar for arch
Nov 17 04:46:31 .:Fergorn:.	also is there a use case for cron now? or am i to do everything with systemd timers?
Nov 17 04:46:55 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - you want to look at snapper then https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/snapper
Nov 17 04:46:56 .:phrik:.	Title: Snapper - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 17 04:47:55 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - you do what you are comfortable with, that's the point. =]
Nov 17 04:48:41 .:Guimauve:.	cron isn't going away and likely never will
Nov 17 04:48:49 .:Fergorn:.	i was using cron wtih openrc, but if i use systemd it makes sense to use their timers i think, and i have been told they are more dependable than cron
Nov 17 04:50:06 .:Namarrgon:.	if you're scheduling something that is interacting with other systemd units then use a timer, otherwise use whatever you prefer
Nov 17 04:50:32 .:Fergorn:.	also how does arch manage build time options? do they build the most common options into the main package, and the rest are split? and does this happen for everything or will i be forced to manually build packages if i want something not included?
Nov 17 04:50:40 .:Namarrgon:.	writing times is a bit more effort than adding a single line to crontab
Nov 17 04:50:44 .:Namarrgon:.	*timers
Nov 17 04:50:56 .:Fergorn:.	Namarrgon oh ok
Nov 17 04:50:57 .:Namarrgon:.	arch includes everything 
Nov 17 04:51:33 .:Namarrgon:.	where possible dependencies are split into optional dependencies
Nov 17 04:52:44 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - before you get into installing on btrfs, just a heads up, make a subvolume for anything you DONT want to be in your snapshots. even if you don't actually care for any other reason. you might want /var/log as a @var_log subvolume, for example, so that your logs aren't part of your root filesystem snapshots. 
Nov 17 04:52:55 .:Fergorn:.	everything into one package? i thought it used package spliting as debian. like package-main package-main-featureA etc
Nov 17 04:53:18 .:Namarrgon:.	no, we embrace the bloat
Nov 17 04:53:29 .:gehidore:.	embrace it!
Nov 17 04:54:03 .:Fergorn:.	Namarrgon actually might be better that way, package spliting seemed messy to me. i prefer one package source or binary
Nov 17 04:54:29 .:Guimauve:.	completely off topic, but i still can't believe arch uses subversion for its package repo
Nov 17 04:54:50 .:Fergorn:.	at least it doesnt use rsync
Nov 17 04:55:01 .:topcat001:.	or cvs
Nov 17 04:55:17 .:espresso:.	h4rd3n3d: Now I find it was not my MB saying "Error getting loaded image path: ?" but systemd-boot. at least hw prognosis is good (thanks). https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/boot/efi/boot.c#L2681
Nov 17 04:56:27 .:Fergorn:.	has anyone here ever used gentoo on a low end laptop?
Nov 17 04:57:09 .:Namarrgon:.	someone in #gentoo probably did
Nov 17 04:57:18 .:topcat001:.	espresso: in the worst case you can try disconnecting the drive so that the fw is not confused, and then remove some boot entries (I remember seeing a firmware space warning).
Nov 17 04:57:21 .:Guimauve:.	Fergorn - maybe 20 years ago when i was an excitable teenager
Nov 17 04:57:26 .:Namarrgon:.	topcat001: or post-it notes
Nov 17 04:57:37 .:topcat001:.	:D
Nov 17 04:58:03 .:Fergorn:.	Guimauve i did. had to change fan couple of times. died real fast, also very miserable experience
Nov 17 04:58:24 .:Fergorn:.	someone told me sure run it, no problem...
Nov 17 04:58:44 .:topcat001:.	I was a Gentoo user and love(d) it, but building Chrome killed me.
Nov 17 04:59:06 .:topcat001:.	Arch is only slightly less hardcore ;)
Nov 17 04:59:18 .:Fergorn:.	i use qutebrowser which used the chrome engine, 9 hours of building
Nov 17 04:59:31 .:Fergorn:.	you need an actual pc for this kind of thing
Nov 17 04:59:59 .:topcat001:.	9 hours sounds about right on a decent machine; forget a core 2 duo or some such laptop!
Nov 17 05:00:26 .:Fergorn:.	i am not running gentoo again except on a desktop with intel xeon or something
Nov 17 05:00:54 .:Fergorn:.	someone on reddit mentioned building chrome in 30 minutes
Nov 17 05:01:03 .:topcat001:.	I probably won't go back. I love pacman/PKGBUILDs.
Nov 17 05:01:57 .:espresso:.	topcat001: thanks for ideas. I don't know if I'll ever find out what I changed to cause that; maybe the uninstall of grub months ago? It's still btrfs root with vfat partition. bootloader stuff still wildly confusing
Nov 17 05:02:46 .:Fergorn:.	i dont like any of the binary package managers i have tried so far (except maybe dnf because of how they do a dependency tree and deltas etc) but i don't have a choice unless i want to kill another machine yet
Nov 17 05:03:12 .:topcat001:.	espresso: I think people should start with systemd-boot and only consider grub if all else fails - IMHO.

Nov 17 06:00:14 .:Namarrgon:.	what changed? you switched from grub to systemd-boot?
Nov 17 06:01:57 .:espresso:.	I switched from grub to systemd months and several kernels ago with no issues until a couple days ago..
Nov 17 06:02:27 .:Namarrgon:.	is vmlinuz-linux still in /boot?
Nov 17 06:02:31 .:espresso:.	yes
Nov 17 06:03:44 .:espresso:.	bootctl  does show 'broken' info like Firmware: n/a and red boxes on all features instead of checkboxes
Nov 17 06:04:16 .:Namarrgon:.	if you umount /boot then /boot is empty?
Nov 17 06:04:45 .:Namarrgon:.	post the bootctl output in the chroot too
Nov 17 06:05:36 .:espresso:.	Namarrgon: it's 'broken' in the chroot. and wow, there are now files on unmounted /boot I did not see before
Nov 17 06:05:58 .:Namarrgon:.	which files are there?
Nov 17 06:06:25 .:espresso:.	all the .img and kernel, no EFI stuff
Nov 17 06:06:59 .:Scimmia:.	anything from ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars ?
Nov 17 06:07:10 .:Namarrgon:.	remove them, mount the ESP again, reinstall the kernel and ucode packages
Nov 17 06:07:31 .:espresso:.	Scimmia: nothing from efivars.. Namarrgon: will do
Nov 17 06:07:59 .:Scimmia:.	so the issue with bootctl is that you booted with the CSM, ie BIOS compatibility mode
Nov 17 06:09:24 .:espresso:.	I certainly try not to but it's possible, as it somewhat mixes BIOS and EFI entries
Nov 17 06:09:58 .:espresso:.	the UEFI boots emit a victorious chirp
Nov 17 06:14:49 .:espresso:.	Namarrgon: Hm, no dice, back to archiso..
Nov 17 06:15:11 .:Namarrgon:.	did you get any errors reinstalling the packages?
Nov 17 06:15:35 .:espresso:.	none
Nov 17 06:18:34 .:espresso:.	bootctl  http://ix.io/4g5v
Nov 17 06:21:13 .:Namarrgon:.	you booted the iso in legacy mode again
Nov 17 06:23:44 .:Scimmia:.	What, exactly, is /boot/EFI/Linux/archlinux-linux.efi?
Nov 17 06:23:49 .:espresso:.	oh! I did verify per wiki that I could read efivars so I guess I assumed..
Nov 17 06:24:16 .:Namarrgon:.	how did you verify that?
Nov 17 06:25:29 .:espresso:.	`efivar -l`  showed the variables.  choosing the other boot entry for the archiso gives 'error listing variables'
Nov 17 06:26:09 .:espresso:.	Scimmia: i think bootctl install puts those there
Nov 17 06:26:19 .:Scimmia:.	no it doesn't
Nov 17 06:27:26 .:espresso:.	at this point, things are a bit of a blur, but i didn't go out of my way to get those there. either mkinitcpio or by installing 
Nov 17 06:28:09 .:Scimmia:.	somehow you made a unified kernel image
Nov 17 06:28:26 .:Scimmia:.	and that's the default that it's trying to load
Nov 17 06:44:16 .:Tahvok:.	Hey guys! I cannot find much info - but does running `systemctl --user set-environment` will save it permamently? For some reason after latest update of arch it does not save the configuration after reboot

Nov 17 06:55:02 .:Guimauve:.	greetings and salutations

Nov 17 07:01:14 .:korrama:.	How long you can hold update on Arch?
Nov 17 07:01:54 .:Scimmia:.	if you're asking that question, look at another distro

Nov 17 07:03:08 .:korrama:.	I try hold update for more than 6 month, and nothing bad happen as long I read the updates on website 
Nov 17 07:03:14 .:ectospasm:.	I run a few different servers on Arch, including my file server, an old workstation, and this VPS.
Nov 17 07:03:29 .:ectospasm:.	But I do keep them reasonably up to date
Nov 17 07:03:53 .:ectospasm:.	I upgrade everything between once a week and once a month, depending on how busy I am with life.
Nov 17 07:04:21 .:ectospasm:.	Oh, yeah, and my DIY router runs Arch
Nov 17 07:04:40 .:korrama:.	Wow, How long did you stick with Arch?
Nov 17 07:04:45 .:Guimauve:.	a rolling release isn't something i'd want for a web server, especially if i'm the one called at 2am to fix shit when a point version upgrade to ruby or python or whatever completely destroys an app somehow. but that's just me. i also love macos, but wouldn't run a mac server remotely either. 
Nov 17 07:05:45 .:ectospasm:.	Guimauve: I run my personal websites in a docker-compose stack, and a system upgrade doesn't upgrade those versions 
Nov 17 07:05:59 .:yitz:.	You don't do a rolling update at 2am
Nov 17 07:06:14 .:korrama:.	Yes, for client server maybe like a chaos
Nov 17 07:06:20 .:ectospasm:.	I mean, I guess the underlying docker stack gets upgraded, but I haven't run into any issues with that, yet.  Yet being the operative word.

Nov 17 07:18:23 .:Guimauve:.	bwanda - i would suggest re-installing vim and vim-runtime. if that doesn't help you, i give up
Nov 17 07:18:35 .:Guimauve:.	i think it will though
Nov 17 07:19:01 .:espresso:.	h4rd3n3d:  bootctl install  copies systemd-bootx64.efi to /boot/EFI/ dirs systemd && BOOT but not Linux (wiki says is for unified) and says it creates an EFI boot entry "Linux Boot Manager". but I suspect these lead to the same "Error getting loaded image path: ?", but probably have more reading to do (and can check how an older backup was configured)
Nov 17 07:27:23 .:h4rd3n3d:.	espresso:  I hope you get it figured out quickly; if not, I'm surprised you haven't already reverted to the previously known to work grub 
Nov 17 07:33:04 .:espresso:.	h4rd3n3d: one thing I note is that I'm not using an extended bootloader partition, but everything on vfat ESP.. *shrug* It had been some time since grub, but that may just save a lot of time.

Nov 17 07:45:48 .:espresso:.	oh yes. *nix, c++, challenges at first sight :D
Nov 17 07:49:25 .:Guimauve:.	i remember using earlier versions of grub instead of lilo as a kid. it was revolutionary. i could tell the computer to DO THINGS instead of just being boned when i messed up! and this was _before_ it was half as useful or stable as it is now.

Nov 17 07:51:23 .:bluetail:.	I know its normal in america
Nov 17 07:51:25 .:bluetail:.	doesnt mean I like it
Nov 17 07:52:12 .:bluetail:.	there seems even tradition to shoot a gun for fun... too bad I know somebody who shot himself after a malfunction and now hes disabled
Nov 17 07:53:41 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - anyways, did you set your swapfile as not being CoW safe for btrfs? cuz that's all i'm aware of being necessary, but i also don't hibernate so i'm talking out of my behind. =]
Nov 17 07:53:55 .:bluetail:.	I dont know
Nov 17 07:54:04 .:bluetail:.	the documentation sucks
Nov 17 07:54:17 .:bluetail:.	I searched for a blog explaining every step but even that fails
Nov 17 07:54:21 .:bluetail:.	so I kinda not use it at all
Nov 17 07:54:37 .:bluetail:.	u could say I cant read
Nov 17 07:54:51 .:bluetail:.	but I wont mess with it until it works cause I know I break something
Nov 17 07:54:59 .:bluetail:.	I already tried stuffs
Nov 17 07:55:20 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - chattr +C <swapfile> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs#Disabling_CoW
Nov 17 07:55:21 .:phrik:.	Title: Btrfs - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 17 07:55:24 .:bluetail:.	My concern was just conserving some energy cause I pay 40 cent per kwh
Nov 17 07:55:31 .:bluetail:.	I read that stuff
Nov 17 07:55:50 .:bluetail:.	I'm one of those 'stupid' archinstall guys
Nov 17 07:56:19 .:bluetail:.	I need a tool to guide me or a small script
Nov 17 07:57:09 .:gehidore:.	or you can do it manually
Nov 17 07:57:21 .:gehidore:.	cause it's never too late to learn
Nov 17 07:57:21 .:bluetail:.	I mean, I read the guide and was lost easily
Nov 17 07:57:30 .:bluetail:.	it says create a swapfile, I could do that
Nov 17 07:57:38 .:bluetail:.	then it says, create a subvolume for btrfs, I didnt understand that
Nov 17 07:58:26 .:bluetail:.	I wasnt even ready. swapon --show shows that I already have swap, but when I wanna hibernate it says its too small
Nov 17 07:58:40 .:bluetail:.	it has 4G and 512K is used...
Nov 17 07:58:52 .:bluetail:.	its located at /dev/zram0
Nov 17 07:58:54 .:egl:.	512k of swap used
Nov 17 07:59:01 .:egl:.	how much total memory do you have
Nov 17 07:59:02 .:jmariondev:.	how much RAM is in the system?
Nov 17 07:59:05 .:egl:.	and what is its usage?
Nov 17 07:59:05 .:bluetail:.	32GB
Nov 17 07:59:07 .:egl:.	lol
Nov 17 07:59:12 .:bluetail:.	4G
Nov 17 07:59:16 .:bluetail:.	3.78 *
Nov 17 07:59:17 .:jmariondev:.	you need to make your swap file at least that size
Nov 17 07:59:18 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - btrfs has a glorious feature for snapshot backups and the like, but you don't want to back up your swapfile containing the state of virtual memory. so you create a subvolume to contain it, so that it's not part of your root filesystem volume and doesn't become part of that snapshot. 
Nov 17 07:59:44 .:egl:.	to sanely hibernate into swap on disk, you should set your swap file/volume to the same size as your RAM 
Nov 17 08:00:41 .:bluetail:.	I mean I set the /dev/zram0 in the fstab in systemd and it would not map it
Nov 17 08:01:08 .:bluetail:.	was like... resume=/dev/zram0... dmesg put an error
Nov 17 08:01:34 .:egl:.	bluetail: swapfile, partition, volume, disk?
Nov 17 08:01:36 .:bluetail:.	egl could I just resize the swapfile during operation and hibernate manually without touching anything else?
Nov 17 08:01:50 .:bluetail:.	egl partition
Nov 17 08:02:00 .:egl:.	you need lengthen the partition
Nov 17 08:02:13 .:bluetail:.	I search on the wiki howto do that
Nov 17 08:02:24 .:egl:.	brtfs? zfs? ext?
Nov 17 08:02:31 .:bluetail:.	btrfs
Nov 17 08:02:50 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - but, technically, you dont HAVE to use a subvolume in btrfs for your swapfile. you DO have to set it CoW unsafe with chattr +C <swapfile> once you make one of the right size. 
Nov 17 08:03:11 .:bluetail:.	but then I lose checksumming
Nov 17 08:03:35 .:bluetail:.	I dont like that either
Nov 17 08:03:43 .:bluetail:.	perhaps I just shut down the machine when not in use!
Nov 17 08:03:49 .:Guimauve:.	lol
Nov 17 08:04:09 .:egl:.	well
Nov 17 08:04:12 .:egl:.	lol
Nov 17 08:04:14 .:egl:.	its swap
Nov 17 08:04:18 .:egl:.	its vram
Nov 17 08:04:55 .:egl:.	i udnerstand your need for it, even your want. but im over here running ZFS and swapping into a dedicated partition directly on the disk.
Nov 17 08:05:09 .:egl:.	if my hibernation fails, oh well reboot. how often does it fail? practically never?
Nov 17 08:05:17 .:bluetail:.	wait... disabling copy on write only affects the partition?
Nov 17 08:05:22 .:bluetail:.	I thought it was globally
Nov 17 08:05:34 .:Guimauve:.	NO! omg, it only affects that file if you use chattr
Nov 17 08:05:41 .:Guimauve:.	i'm sorry
Nov 17 08:05:46 .:egl:.	that said, you need to resize your btrfs subvolume to match the size of your installed RAM to be SANE/SAFE with hibernating. You could get away with half... but what if you are running multiple proggies and have it loaded all up?
Nov 17 08:05:47 .:Guimauve:.	i wasn't descriptive enough
Nov 17 08:05:58 .:Guimauve:.	if you chattr of a file, that only changes attributes of that file
Nov 17 08:06:08 .:Guimauve:.	so ONLY the swapfile is marked as being CoW unsafe
Nov 17 08:06:09 .:egl:.	chattr != COW
Nov 17 08:06:14 .:egl:.	^
Nov 17 08:06:25 .:bluetail:.	thanks for explaining
Nov 17 08:06:41 .:egl:.	i have 64GB on my lappy...
Nov 17 08:06:55 .:egl:.	so ya I waste 64GB on disk just for lil swappy blocks.
Nov 17 08:07:39 .:Scimmia:.	which is totally unnecessary
Nov 17 08:07:44 .:bluetail:.	so I have to touch the zram for this, right?
Nov 17 08:08:11 .:Scimmia:.	first off, you're never going to hibernate when it's full. Second, it's compressed on disk
Nov 17 08:08:24 .:egl:.	maybe for you
Nov 17 08:08:34 .:egl:.	im not here for hobby
Nov 17 08:08:35 .:Scimmia:.	and chattr, used as specified, DOES affect COW
Nov 17 08:08:53 .:Guimauve:.	(but only for that file)
Nov 17 08:08:54 .:egl:.	and i fill up ~56GB of it pretty consistently
Nov 17 08:09:04 .:another|:.	egl: you fill 64G to the brim? and hibernate?
Nov 17 08:09:14 .:Scimmia:.	while actively processing something, maybe, but you're not going to hibernate during that
Nov 17 08:09:36 .:Scimmia:.	and even then, how much of that is cache?
Nov 17 08:09:41 .:egl:.	another|: not on purpose, but if I have to lockup and move then yes. this is what you get when you run hashcat all of the time and do other stupid memory instensive BS like a loser
Nov 17 08:09:52 .:egl:.	i am a cuda developer
Nov 17 08:10:04 .:egl:.	and I like to slap my machine shut whenever i want
Nov 17 08:10:12 .:bluetail:.	so for hibernation, I edit '/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf' and add the lines zram-fraction=0.5 and max-zram-size=32768 and then use systemctl restart systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service ?
Nov 17 08:10:13 .:egl:.	could be pron, could be l33t, could be surfing the webs
Nov 17 08:10:28 .:bluetail:.	and then I should theoretically be able to issue hibernation?
Nov 17 08:10:36 .:Guimauve:.	egl - if you have 64G of pron in-memory, you need a support group :p
Nov 17 08:10:48 .:egl:.	Guimauve: :D
Nov 17 08:10:57 .:another|:.	bluetail: what is this about hibernating to zram?
Nov 17 08:11:38 .:bluetail:.	I don't know. I see I need swap to hibernate. I used swapon --show and saw theres already swap, type partition, name /dev/zram0. So I thought if I extend this partition, I could hibernate
Nov 17 08:11:56 .:bluetail:.	but zram0 is only 4G in size
Nov 17 08:11:59 .:another|:.	no
Nov 17 08:12:09 .:egl:.	ya jsut to be clear hibernating to zram would be neat. ill buy you a yacht if you can pull it off.
Nov 17 08:12:13 .:another|:.	zram is in memory
Nov 17 08:12:19 .:egl:.	^
Nov 17 08:12:42 .:another|:.	you can't save your memory to memory
Nov 17 08:12:45 .:egl:.	your zram would be something that gets PAGED to your swap partition when hibernating.
Nov 17 08:12:55 .:bluetail:.	yea that doesnt make sense
Nov 17 08:12:56 .:egl:.	another|: but would you download more memory?
Nov 17 08:13:08 .:another|:.	always
Nov 17 08:13:11 .:egl:.	VRAM(RAM(ZRAM))
Nov 17 08:13:16 .:bluetail:.	you guys are clearly trying to help me. 
Nov 17 08:13:19 .:egl:.	VRAM(RAM(ZRAM),SWAP)
Nov 17 08:13:26 .:egl:.	^ general layout lol
Nov 17 08:14:06 .:another|:.	hmm.. what happens to VRAM on hibernate?
Nov 17 08:14:56 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - but i'm not that great at it, and i'm 2 glasses of wine into my evening, so i'll leave it to the experts :p
Nov 17 08:15:09 .:nmy:.	so.. hibernate to disk
Nov 17 08:15:33 .:egl:.	vRAM == Virtual RAM, which is the total of your RAM + SWAP (give or take caching stuff). ZRAM is a virtual block device that resides in RAM... think high speed caching. ZRAM is a fake disk... on RAM. You could swap to it, but it wont be there when the power shuts off.... because ZRAM is a virtual block device that exists on volatile RAM.
Nov 17 08:16:13 .:egl:.	Hibernation != sleep, either. just to say it.
Nov 17 08:16:23 .:bluetail:.	so... I read https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs#Swap_file and it says I have to create a new subvolume. So I go to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs#Creating_a_subvolume and it says "btrfs subvolume create /path/to/subvolume"  Once that is issued, would it be enough to issue '# chattr +C /path/to/swapsubvolume' ? 
Nov 17 08:16:24 .:phrik:.	Title: Btrfs - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 17 08:16:46 .:bluetail:.	there has to be something missing. At no point size was defined!
Nov 17 08:16:50 .:egl:.	you need to create the subvolume, mkfs.swap, swapon subvolume
Nov 17 08:17:05 .:egl:.	err mkfs.swap lol not that
Nov 17 08:17:43 .:Scimmia:.	no, no you don't
Nov 17 08:18:03 .:another|:.	egl: I thought you meant video memory
Nov 17 08:18:18 .:Scimmia:.	bluetail: click on the link from the first link you posted
Nov 17 08:18:29 .:Scimmia:.	it tells you how to create the swap file
Nov 17 08:18:36 .:egl:.	Scimmia: you are right: sudo mount -m -U ${fs_uuid} -o subvol=@swap,nodatacow /swap
Nov 17 08:18:47 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - you don't _technically_ have to create a subvolume, but it is useful. but then you create a file ON that subvolume, and chattr _that_. this file you can create with dd via dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file bs=1M count=size-in-megs 
Nov 17 08:18:48 .:Scimmia:.	again, no
Nov 17 08:18:54 .:Guimauve:.	egl = no
Nov 17 08:19:04 .:Guimauve:.	egl - btrfs uses the same options for all subvolumes
Nov 17 08:19:24 .:Guimauve:.	egl - and ignored all but the first mounted subvolume's options
Nov 17 08:19:32 .:another|:.	Guimauve: no. you +C the subvol so the file created in there is already nocow from creation
Nov 17 08:19:45 .:Guimauve:.	another| - that works? 
Nov 17 08:19:46 .:Scimmia:.	egl: please read the wiki before giving advice
Nov 17 08:19:53 .:Guimauve:.	another| - good to know. thanks :)
Nov 17 08:19:54 .:egl:.	Ahh, but the swapfile ~= partition
Nov 17 08:20:01 .:egl:.	Scimmia: relax my guy
Nov 17 08:20:02 .:another|:.	Guimauve: Why do you think it's like that in the wiki?
Nov 17 08:20:23 .:bluetail:.	oh. I understand... I guess I will do it eventually, but probably not at all.
Nov 17 08:20:51 .:another|:.	 Guimauve re: same options: depends
Nov 17 08:21:15 .:bluetail:.	used dd a couple of times, wrote to the wrong location, felt dumb and restored from backup ... all that stuff yet again... no... not in the foreseeable future
Nov 17 08:21:43 .:bluetail:.	I probably search for a blogpost somewhere outside of the actual wiki
Nov 17 08:22:03 .:bluetail:.	I dont wanna wreck my os...
Nov 17 08:22:37 .:bluetail:.	Perhaps I should create a script that does the entire process, and submit it to the wiki
Nov 17 08:22:57 .:Scimmia:.	it will just get reverted
Nov 17 08:23:02 .:Scimmia:.	instructions are there
Nov 17 08:23:05 .:bluetail:.	how frustrating
Nov 17 08:23:24 .:bluetail:.	yea, but the instructions are too generic and span across pages
Nov 17 08:23:36 .:bluetail:.	Its not that I do not want to read
Nov 17 08:23:47 .:bluetail:.	I am afraid of breaking things on a productive system
Nov 17 08:23:53 .:Scimmia:.	they're not generic at all, they tell you exactly what to do and have links to each section
Nov 17 08:24:19 .:bluetail:.	I like the gentoo wiki much better, although it is way too verbose at times
Nov 17 08:25:05 .:bluetail:.	I'll find a resource, somewhere... sometime
Nov 17 08:25:11 .:Scimmia:.	maybe that would be a better distro for you, then
Nov 17 08:25:17 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - people often joke that arch linux is a wiki and not a distribution because the docs are that good
Nov 17 08:25:23 .:egl:.	bluetail: dont listen to him, hes a classic poopiebutt
Nov 17 08:25:45 .:egl:.	bluetail: you can remove your current swapfile, and create a new one, swapon it, and set the attributes as the wiki says
Nov 17 08:25:50 .:bluetail:.	thank you for defending me. I'll be out and send you hearts via dm
Nov 17 08:26:00 .:another|:.	egl: no
Nov 17 08:26:06 .:Scimmia:.	and egl is a classic 'talking out of my ass and hoping people don't realize that I don't know what I'm saying'
Nov 17 08:26:12 .:Guimauve:.	bluetail - good luck. i hope you figure it out. 
Nov 17 08:26:18 .:another|:.	those steps are in the wrong order. read the iki
Nov 17 08:26:21 .:another|:.	*wiki
Nov 17 08:27:35 .:egl:.	bluetail: 1) delete old 2) do this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Swap_file 3) then https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs#Swap_file 
Nov 17 08:27:37 .:phrik:.	Title: Swap - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 17 08:27:52 .:another|:.	NO
Nov 17 08:27:52 .:egl:.	Scimmia: god youve been an ass for over 10 years and not even the move to libra has gotten you to relx
Nov 17 08:28:10 .:egl:.	lol peace
Nov 17 08:28:23 .:Scimmia:.	and that last message just proves my point. DO NOT DO what egl said, it'll screw everything up
Nov 17 08:31:14 .:Scimmia:.	and by default, the kernel tries to make the hibernation image no more than 2/5 of the size of your RAM. Saying it needs to be the same is demonstratibly crap
Nov 17 08:32:38 .:Scimmia:.	especially in a situation like this where the swap file is just for hibernation and not actual swap
Nov 17 08:33:37 .:another|:.	Scimmia: IIRC that is not a limit though
Nov 17 08:33:54 .:Scimmia:.	true, not a limit, but 1/2 ram will work in almost all situations
Nov 17 08:34:34 .:Scimmia:.	with the compression, it would never need to be 100%
Nov 17 08:40:06 .:another|:.	don't say never
Nov 17 08:40:09 .:lolok:.	zswap is a thing tho, ya know if you wanna compress your ram while its still in ram, you can actually do that
Nov 17 08:40:41 .:another|:.	note: zram != zswap
Nov 17 08:41:07 .:lolok:.	yea that one
Nov 17 08:43:47 .:lolok:.	or the other actually idk, that would be a fun test to benchmark them, next time i feel like thrashing my system lol
Nov 17 08:44:06 .:eagle:.	thrash hard bro
Nov 17 08:44:35 .:lolok:.	i didnt see the upper side of 4gb ram until last year
Nov 17 08:45:19 .:eagle:.	whats a good use case for zram (outside of like redis) or zswap, unless its like you got little to no disk and quetionably configured mem?
Nov 17 08:47:39 .:lolok:.	less writes means more life to flash memory, its allegedly faster too, i knew it was a thing but i nveer really looked too deep at it
Nov 17 08:48:03 .:eagle:.	trade off is compute time?
Nov 17 08:48:18 .:eagle:.	i could see it for a hypervisor...
Nov 17 08:48:21 .:lolok:.	yea power consumption
Nov 17 08:48:28 .:eagle:.	and GPU programming...
Nov 17 08:48:34 .:eagle:.	interesting.
Nov 17 09:01:50 .:bluetail:.	I tried again. 1. sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=32768 status=progress 2. sudo mkswap -U clear /swapfile  3. sudo chattr +C /swapfile  4. sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile 5.  sudo swapon /swapfile  
Nov 17 09:01:50 .:bluetail:.	result=swapon: /swapfile: swapon failed: Invalid argument
Nov 17 09:03:46 .:bluetail:.	I also tried as sudo -i but no luck
Nov 17 09:04:28 .:bluetail:.	I mean, could be I require a subvolume, do I require one on btrfs? Reading previous comments, it seems I do not
Nov 17 09:08:52 .:akibageek:.	Hey all. Ever used dracut? Are there cases where it actually was a lifesaver?
Nov 17 09:10:02 .:eagle:.	bluetail youve got to set chattr on the subvol, not the swapfile... which resides on the subvol
Nov 17 09:10:27 .:bluetail:.	oh... I see
Nov 17 09:10:29 .:grawity:.	afaik you can do it on a file, but chattr +C only makes sense on an empty file
Nov 17 09:10:39 .:eagle:.	^
Nov 17 09:10:47 .:eagle:.	grawity will answer cleaner than I will
Nov 17 09:10:57 .:grawity:.	or on the parent directory before the file is created
Nov 17 09:11:20 .:bluetail:.	oh so I can use mkdir
Nov 17 09:13:25 .:bluetail:.	it seems to map as type file now... If it works, well, but otherwise, I hated the process
Nov 17 09:13:46 .:bluetail:.	yea
Nov 17 09:14:04 .:bluetail:.	sudo systemctl hibernate > 'Call to Hibernate failed: Not enough swap space for hibernation'
Nov 17 09:14:24 .:bluetail:.	sudo swapon --show  > /swap/swapfile file       32G   0B   -2
Nov 17 09:15:46 .:bluetail:.	grawity do u know whats the issue?
Nov 17 09:18:27 .:eagle:.	bluetail: 1) create subvol, 2) chmod the subvol, 3) create mountpoint dir (like /swap), 4) add line to fstab (example: /dev/disk/id /swap btrfs defaults,noatime,subvol=swap 0 0), 5) mount /swap, 6) create empty swapfile /swap/swapfile, 7) chattr +C either the subvol or the /swap/swapfile, 8) disable compression on /swap/swapfile, 9) chmod /swap/swapfile and mkswap it, 10) swapon 
Nov 17 09:18:40 .:eagle:.	bluetail: thats gonna be close, not exact, and should leave you with enough to research to learn
Nov 17 09:19:04 .:lolok:.	akibageek dracut is allegedly faster to boot, but afaik nothing about it is any safer, if anything its probably the less stable option
Nov 17 09:19:40 .:bluetail:.	I'm confused now. I thought a subvol meant I do not need a folder... and vice versa
Nov 17 09:20:00 .:bluetail:.	I think I have to delete /swap/swapfile 
Nov 17 09:21:00 .:eagle:.	volumes get mounted to mount points, exposing the volume as definitive section of "disk" to the kernel. you did this for your root file system (assuming you installed this yourself) already.
Nov 17 09:21:05 .:eagle:.	or similar actions thereof
Nov 17 09:21:27 .:bluetail:.	I used archinstall cause the beginners guide was deleted
Nov 17 09:21:39 .:lolok:.	dafaq?
Nov 17 09:21:42 .:eagle:.	and you chose btrfs?  is this your first install?
Nov 17 09:21:59 .:bluetail:.	I used archinstall a lot, this is not my first installment through archinstall
Nov 17 09:22:05 .:bluetail:.	before...
Nov 17 09:22:12 .:bluetail:.	I followed a guide which was just removed
Nov 17 09:22:17 .:bluetail:.	I mean before archinstall
Nov 17 09:23:10 .:nmy:.	imho ... btrfs seems cool, but I had an external drive just stop booting up my btrfs encyrpted partition
Nov 17 09:23:51 .:nmy:.	the same drive mounts for storage just fine read/write
Nov 17 09:24:25 .:eagle:.	nmy: opposite here, encrypted zfs root, and want to encrypt my swap sanely without have extra keys laying about...
Nov 17 09:24:30 .:eagle:.	nmy: gives me the big cry
Nov 17 09:24:34 .:nmy:.	my install was so long ago - arch in 2011 - that I don't know what I used then. 
Nov 17 09:24:41 .:nmy:.	I see your problem
Nov 17 09:24:45 .:nmy:.	yes
Nov 17 09:25:21 .:eagle:.	btrfs seemed cool, but ya... its definitely pure tedium in comparison to even zfs... 
Nov 17 09:25:25 .:nmy:.	my honest solution - not using much ram here - is to have 32GB ram
Nov 17 09:25:41 .:eagle:.	but it would NOT be my choise of fs to LEARN the basic of vnoumenn architectures lol
Nov 17 09:27:00 .:grawity:.	doesn't everyone say "do not put swap on zfs lol"
Nov 17 09:27:14 .:eagle:.	grawity: yes, and definitely dont
Nov 17 09:27:16 .:bluetail:.	I guess I dont try until I feel better again. Everytime I have todo something in arch that doesnt involve actual programming, I get so frustrated and feel that I hardly can learn because the wiki is written not as tutorial, but more as technical reference guide.

Nov 17 10:00:20 .:grawity:.	",password publickey," is nonsensical
Nov 17 10:00:28 .:grawity:.	it's half of one item and half of another
Nov 17 10:00:33 .:Strykar:.	its from your example above :p
Nov 17 10:00:42 .:grawity:.	that's two space-separated items
Nov 17 10:00:43 .:eagle:.	no it isnt
Nov 17 10:00:47 .:grawity:.	not three comma-separated items
Nov 17 10:01:00 .:grawity:.	(and no, the server cannot enforce ssh cert passphrases in any way)
Nov 17 10:01:15 .:jkc:.	Strykar: The fact that you're unable to interpret those options correctly implies that this isn't something you should be undertaking.
Nov 17 10:01:29 .:eagle:.	lol
Nov 17 10:01:48 .:jkc:.	Yubikey, generate pgp key on the key, use auth subkey for ssh. 2FA done without any of this mess.

Nov 17 10:02:10 .:Strykar:.	its copy pasted from your example above, anyhow, what does "password publickey" do that publickey does not?
Nov 17 10:02:17 .:grawity:.	why would you use pgp for that if you have a yubikey with ccid mode
Nov 17 10:03:10 .:eagle:.	its only legit if you sign them with your gpg key
Nov 17 10:03:10 .:grawity:.	Strykar: okay then, what does "py past" mean
Nov 17 10:03:13 .:grawity:.	Strykar: in your last sentence
Nov 17 10:03:19 .:grawity:.	Strykar: what does "ample abo" mean
Nov 17 10:03:33 .:jkc:.	grawity: what? openpgp applet on the yubikey goes over ccid
Nov 17 10:04:01 .:grawity:.	jkc: ok, piv mode
Nov 17 10:05:04 .:grawity:.	Strykar: the example does not have "password publickey" as a method at all -- it has "publickey,password" as one method and "publickey,keyboard-interactive" in another
Nov 17 10:05:21 .:grawity:.	Strykar: because the list is space-separated no matter how hard you're trying to read it as a comma-separated one
Nov 17 10:05:32 .:jkc:.	grawity: piv spec limits you to 2048-bit rsa, currently.
Nov 17 10:06:20 .:Strykar:.	grawity: ah, sry misread it. and the arch wiki does explain it, on a diff page - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/One_Time_PassWord#PAM_configuration
Nov 17 10:06:22 .:phrik:.	Title: One Time PassWord - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Nov 17 10:06:30 .:grawity:.	jkc: so don't use rsa with it, use p256
Nov 17 10:07:18 .:grawity:.	I've just had way too many troubles with gpg-agent for SSH, even on linux (I don't even want to start installing gnupg on windows...)
Nov 17 10:07:37 .:grawity:.	compared to setting a PKCS11Provider and having it just work
Nov 17 10:08:38 .:jkc:.	grawity: oh hey, ecdsa is a thing there. last I remember looking at it, rsa was all my org cared about.
Nov 17 10:08:46 .:jkc:.	I've got some tinkering to do.
Nov 17 10:08:50 .:jkc:.	grawity: thank ya

Nov 17 10:13:32 .:grawity:.	my two-yubikeys-for-€20 just arrived yesterday, I still haven't decided what to do with them
Nov 17 10:13:45 .:grawity:.	cloudflare still has the offer up I think
Nov 17 10:16:16 .:jkc:.	Strykar: At any rate, your initial approach? Just don't. Go with PIV or fido.
Nov 17 10:17:34 .:grawity:.	to be fair, SSH pubkey + TOTP does have probably the highest platform compatibility ... (but probably the lowest convenience)
Nov 17 10:18:42 .:Strykar:.	jkc: it's worked fine for years, just had to revisit it today
Nov 17 10:18:53 .:grawity:.	(and pam_google_authenticator is just TOTP, it's none of that weird Duo stuff)

Nov 17 10:44:15 .:lolok:.	grub is bloated so that when you cant boot you have all the tools you need to fix the problem without fishing out a usb and hoping whatever iso you had on it last isnt ancient

Nov 17 11:19:13 .:h4rd3n3d:.	tusko:  I disagree, completely.  Grub offers outstanding support for LUKS encrypted /boot (or just /) - as well as multi-OS booting the four other nix distros I run, plus Win 11 Pro

Nov 17 11:27:56 .:rounak:.	I don't know why my cairo dock is not working :\
Nov 17 11:29:01 .:Ennea:.	might be your WM moving it elsewhere
Nov 17 11:38:46 .:dagle:.	Hmmm. Is there a tool to make free searches for manpages?
Nov 17 11:39:26 .:grawity:.	`man -K foo`
Nov 17 11:39:34 .:grawity:.	`zgrep -r foo /usr/share/man`
Nov 17 11:39:53 .:grawity:.	google foo site:man.archlinux.org site:manpages.debian.org
Nov 17 11:40:40 .:dagle:.	man -k/K does an apropos search and the info is hidden somewhere that isn't in the "header".
Nov 17 11:35:42 .:woland:.	apropos is useful too
Nov 17 11:41:43 .:grawity:.	man -k does an apropos search, man -K greps the entire thing
Nov 17 11:44:12 .:Dworin:.	I see webkit2gtk depends on libegl/libglvnd. How can I check the required openGL version for it?
Nov 17 11:44:42 .:rounak:.	@Ennea I am using polybar
Nov 17 11:44:46 .:rounak:.	with i3 
Nov 17 11:45:15 .:rounak:.	Here is my i3 config file - http://0x0.st/oIyf.txt

Nov 17 11:41:39 .:woland:.	bumblebee status is also very nice for i3, but I switched to i3blocks recently
Nov 17 11:47:02 .:dagle:.	grawity: Ah, but -K seems rather blunt, I might be better of with zgrep in that case.
Nov 17 11:51:17 .:GuiToris:.	hey, shouldn't this work? pacman -Qs '-git$'
Nov 17 11:52:35 .:grawity:.	the search query is a standalone argument, not a parameter to -s, so it doesn't get an exception from the usual "args starting with - are options" thing
Nov 17 11:52:45 .:grawity:.	meaning you need to -Qs -- '-git$'

Nov 17 12:55:16 .:h4:.	lolok: I know, but in my case, the other one would have been even more convoluted. I don't have any way to use the ISO actually
Nov 17 12:57:05 .:lolok:.	you can install arch from within arch [or another distro] if you can get the storage drive out of whatever system [that i assume] has no usb ports
Nov 17 12:58:39 .:h4:.	lolok: The computer that I try to setup doesn't have anything installed on it yet
Nov 17 12:59:08 .:lolok:.	yes, so you take the drive out, and mount it in another system, install arch to it there, and put it back

Nov 17 12:59:42 .:lolok:.	i guess thats convoluted too but at least you dont have to mess with tftp

Nov 17 14:01:25 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	GuiToris, multiple profiles :D

Nov 17 14:01:52 .:GuiToris:.	I'm checking it, I've never heard of profiles
Nov 17 14:02:45 .:GuiToris:.	I'm not sure if it's more convenient than incognito
Nov 17 14:02:50 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	You need different accounts for profiles, or use the profile as guest which is very similar to incognito with the exception of extensions being activated there by default

I have another big rehawl with pipewire :) One update completely ruined my audio jack as in it seems like audio is too loud I can hear cracking even though alsamixer shows nothing on red.

Nov 17 14:38:27 .:grawity:.	I mean i do use mkinitcpio but not particularly more than anyone else here, only switched it to the systemd-based hooks
Nov 17 14:38:42 .:grawity:.	tbh I didn't know it has release notes
Nov 17 14:39:02 .:Foxboron:.	It doesn't, I'm drafting up a format :)
Nov 17 14:39:47 .:Foxboron:.	And currently I'm just doing a "whatever systemd does, do that" but more opinions would be nice from people that tend to read these things

Nov 17 14:42:56 .:Foxboron:.	Yes, they need a pass or two :) but does the general format look fine? Readable?
Nov 17 14:43:05 .:Foxboron:.	anything that is clearly missing?
Nov 17 14:43:25 .:spaceseller:.	Erus_Iluvatar, not so demanded deep learning, relatively small datasets
Nov 17 14:43:32 .:grawity:.	hmm overall I'd just place possibly breaking changes (like the os-release one) at the top
Nov 17 14:43:35 .:grawity:.	other than that, seems fine
Nov 17 14:44:42 .:grawity:.	"breaking changes > deprecations > new features > "
Nov 17 14:44:48 .:grawity:.	I think that's what systemd does roughly
Nov 17 14:45:30 .:grawity:.	hmm does it mean I need FILES+=(/etc/{os,initrd}-release) or will it still include some other form of initrd-release file?
Nov 17 14:46:30 .:Foxboron:.	Im reading that line and I go "why does it say not"
Nov 17 14:46:56 .:Foxboron:.	Ah s/not/now/
Nov 17 14:48:16 .:Foxboron:.	grawity: previously os-elease was never included and we just created the initrd-release file. 
Nov 17 14:48:22 .:Foxboron:.	Now we include os-release and symlink stuff properly
Nov 17 14:48:22 .:grawity:.	ah

Nov 17 14:48:59 .:Foxboron:.	Then you can soon remove it I guess :)
Nov 17 14:54:34 .:grawity:.	I assume it's the same with "mkinitcpio will not try to properly resolve symlinks"
Nov 17 14:56:10 .:Erus_Iluvatar:.	spaceseller: and you require a single machine to be portable? or splitting your budget between a beefy tower and a "weak"er laptop to access remotely could be possible? 
Nov 17 14:56:41 .:Erus_Iluvatar:.	NVIDIA-only for the GPU? do you already have a budget? 
Nov 17 15:05:22 .:spaceseller:.	Erus_Iluvatar, laptop for preparing models. I have an access to HPC cluster for further R&D. Mobility, yes, but it doesn't have to be superlight. NVIDIA,yes because I don't think so that AMD is CUDA friendly. Budget, hm, I don't want to spend more then 1800Euros.

Nov 17 15:08:41 .:jelle:.	c) what hardware d) did it not work on the normal kernel?
Nov 17 15:09:10 .:chronos3:.	jelle, because my laptop keyboard doesnt work on the stable kernel. 
Nov 17 15:09:28 .:chronos3:.	Audio worked on mainline kernel ubuntu. 
Nov 17 15:10:01 .:jelle:.	chronos3: right, which is not the same as the Arch unsupported mainline kernel
Nov 17 15:10:29 .:chronos3:.	jelle, so what should I do?
Nov 17 15:10:32 .:chronos3:.	how do I fix this
Nov 17 15:10:55 .:jelle:.	I'd fetch the patch which fixes it and build the arch linux kernel with it. But the kernel breaking keyboard sounds weird, laptop?
Nov 17 15:11:14 .:braindamage:.	just to be clear, have you tried both arch the latest and the lts kernels in arch?
Nov 17 15:11:42 .:braindamage:.	because something working/not working using ubuntu is not very indicative, they heavily patch things

Nov 17 15:20:50 .:grawity:.	sounds like you need to have openjdk17 (or openjdk18 lol) to build it
Nov 17 15:21:25 .:segurb:.	that makes no sense at all lol
Nov 17 15:21:45 .:grawity:.	I mean you do need java to compile java because it's written in java, isn't it
Nov 17 15:21:51 .:Ennea:.	openjdk17 exists as a package in the official repos at least
Nov 17 15:22:05 .:Ennea:.	so if you only have openjdk (which tracks version 19 now) but not openjdk17.. might explain it
Nov 17 15:22:07 .:segurb:.	yeah installing it right now

Nov 17 15:24:35 .:braindamage:.	and in the meantime, the dep got removed

Nov 17 15:31:32 .:frojnd:.	I think I found the reason... with wpctl status I noticed 2 pipewire pids and with ps I found out I had also ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-input-filter-chain.service which pointed to "%h/.config/pipewire/filter-chain.conf" I ditched that since noise cancellation is now ueses different setup

Nov 17 15:54:21 .:grawity:.	it is still a very good idea to start dunst like that
Nov 17 15:54:36 .:chronos3:.	what alterations should i make to xprofile
Nov 17 15:54:38 .:grawity:.	because on systems that have more than one such a service installed, it's kinda random as to which one will be launched
Nov 17 15:55:08 .:grawity:.	and that's if dbus-daemon's maintainer doesn't remember their promise to disallow duplicates for session services at all
Nov 17 15:56:11 .:wunit:.	mmh, fair
Nov 17 15:57:03 .:wunit:.	would be nice if dbus had a concept of enabling/disabling services like systemd - but I'm probably missing something obvious ^^
Nov 17 15:57:13 .:grawity:.	it does if you use systemd services for it
Nov 17 15:57:57 .:grawity:.	...but you still need a "shared" dbus .service file, which pacman can't really handle

Nov 17 16:18:18 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	WHat's the output of `journalctl -rn 300` again
Nov 17 16:18:46 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	What you should do is investigate where the other pipewire process is being launched, remove it and that's all
Nov 17 16:20:18 .:chronos3:.	Edu4rdSHL, I systemctl started the pipewire service
Nov 17 16:20:22 .:chronos3:.	should I disable tht?'
Nov 17 16:20:35 .:Erus_Iluvatar:.	spaceseller: maybe a Gigabyte G5 would fit your needs? the Dell G15 would also work but they appear to have vanished everywhere, I don't trust MSI to make a proper laptop, and the Lenovo ThinkPad P15 Gen 2 or ThinkBook 16p are overpriced IMO but would also be OK
Nov 17 16:21:05 .:Erus_Iluvatar:.	Otherwise it's ASUS ROG/TUF gaming laptops so…
Nov 17 16:21:43 .:Erus_Iluvatar:.	The Dell Precision 3551 is overpriced too, but would also work
Nov 17 16:21:52 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	chronos3, no. Honestly, you should learn about user services, pipewire and so on a bit.
Nov 17 16:22:23 .:Edu4rdSHL:.	There's something else starting pipewire before the service is launched, that's causing the problems.

Nov 17 16:45:13 .:spaceseller:.	Erus_Iluvatar, almost same thought about great but overpriced laptops. Though never thought about Gygabite G5. Pretty cheap and powerful. What about reliability? How can be compared against ASUS Rog?
Nov 17 16:45:29 .:Namarrgon:.	lairnc: the error message wasn't exactly helpful

Nov 17 16:58:02 .:spaceseller:.	Erus_Iluvatar, you save lotsof my time. it's so cheap that I will try G5 on ldlc without reading reviews.

Nov 17 16:58:52 .:grawity:.	you can also just write the two lines into /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
Nov 17 16:59:19 .:Namarrgon:.	Ampera: what does "broken" mean?
Nov 17 17:00:50 .:Ampera:.	Every package no longer verifies, as well as the key for the archzfs repo. I couldn't even update archlinux-keyring
Nov 17 17:01:19 .:Namarrgon:.	the archlinux keyring won't have keys for the archzfs repo
Nov 17 17:01:24 .:Ampera:.	I didn't say it would
Nov 17 17:01:33 .:Ampera:.	I added the key myself to it, and it randomly stopped working
Nov 17 17:01:48 .:Namarrgon:.	can you post the pacman --debug output for such a case?
Nov 17 17:01:53 .:Ampera:.	no, because I've fixed it
Nov 17 17:02:25 .:Ampera:.	current issue at the moment is it seems openssl updated, and ffmpeg is still looking for an old libssl
Nov 17 17:02:43 .:Namarrgon:.	that's a partial upgrade. make sure to update the foreign packages aswell

Nov 20 17:31:07 .:diep:.	And didnt see this previously with Firefox, since I use it as my daily driver from several years now, and on this specific machine since 2018
Nov 20 17:31:18 .:diep:.	never encountered that problem before
Nov 20 17:33:01 .:diep:.	It's crazy, like if I start to open like more than 5 tabs, it makes my linux almost unusable because of that uge cpu consumption
Nov 20 17:33:14 .:diep:.	wtf
Nov 20 17:34:49 .:jelle:.	diep: tried a new profile?
Nov 20 17:35:16 .:diep:.	jelle: what do mean by "new profile"?
Nov 20 17:35:22 .:jelle:.	diep: a new firefox profile
Nov 20 17:35:35 .:diep:.	nope as far as I know
Nov 20 17:36:26 .:jelle:.	diep: I mean to say, try a new profile see if it occurs there too
Nov 20 17:36:44 .:diep:.	let me try
Nov 20 17:37:35 .:diep:.	but im not sure, profile is like a firefox account I use to sync all stuff?
Nov 20 17:37:57 .:jelle:.	diep: firefox -P => create profile
Nov 20 17:40:59 .:diep:.	hmm yes on a fresh profile I dont have the problem
Nov 20 17:41:03 .:diep:.	wtf
Nov 20 17:41:14 .:diep:.	could be caused by an addons?
Nov 20 17:41:19 .:jelle:.	it could be yes
Nov 20 17:42:09 .:BrainDamage:.	try --safe-mode to skip loading addons
Nov 20 17:42:32 .:diep:.	yup
Nov 20 17:44:07 .:diep:.	yes with --safe-mode on my default profile the problem is not present as well
Nov 20 17:44:44 .:diep:.	but does not help so much to find out what is the cause, could be addon or a setting
Nov 20 17:44:52 .:diep:.	idk
Nov 20 17:45:47 .:Ennea:.	binary search through your addons. disable half. if the problem persists, disable half of that. if it doesn't, continue with the other half. and so on
Nov 20 17:45:57 .:diep:.	yea
Nov 20 17:46:23 .:diep:.	empirical research
Nov 20 17:46:26 .:diep:.	xD
Nov 20 17:49:06 .:diep:.	interesting
Nov 20 17:49:13 .:diep:.	seems to be metamask
Nov 20 17:49:21 .:diep:.	the cause of the problem
Nov 20 17:49:29 .:Ennea:.	very unsurprising for some reason :p
Nov 20 17:49:39 .:jelle:.	> An Ethereum Wallet in your Browser
Nov 20 17:49:44 .:jelle:.	with free mining!
Nov 20 17:49:52 .:Ennea:.	some crypto/web3/nft addon is suddenly causing cpu spikes? hmmm, what could that _possibly_ be? 😁
Nov 20 17:50:46 .:diep:.	anyway okay thx guys for the help ;)
Nov 20 17:51:02 .:diep:.	firefox now is back to normal :)

Dec 07 05:15:38 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Hello folks!
Dec 07 05:16:54 .:mpan:.	oldfashionedcow: hello. How might we help you?
Dec 07 05:16:54 .:Scimmia:.	!give oldfashionedcow welcome
Dec 07 05:16:54 .:phrik:.	oldfashionedcow: Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
Dec 07 05:17:32 .:oldfashionedcow:.	:)  I have not managed to fuck up. in fact, I would love some thoughts on a little hobby project I threw together:
Dec 07 05:17:37 .:oldfashionedcow:.	https://archlinux.sandhuservices.dev/
Dec 07 05:17:45 .:oldfashionedcow:.	sorry wrong link :D
Dec 07 05:17:52 .:oldfashionedcow:.	https://archinstall.sandhuservices.dev/
Dec 07 05:17:53 .:phrik:.	Title: Rahul Sandhu's Arch Install Docs (at archinstall.sandhuservices.dev)
Dec 07 05:18:14 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Its a wip, I am yet to setup btrbk, but I think it is pretty solid so far.
Dec 07 05:19:00 .:bluetail:.	I like it. But I don't think the archwiki can take such information
Dec 07 05:20:03 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Yeah, I basically wanted a reference for myself, and thought it would be cool to put it out there. I just thought I would run it here in case anyone has any thoughts or opinons on my setup process.
Dec 07 05:23:06 .:Koragg:.	oldfashionedcow: I have a question regarding https://archinstall.sandhuservices.dev/configuring_new_system/ - why do you not make use of visudo ? is the option you use like a more modern or more secure approach?
Dec 07 05:23:08 .:phrik:.	Title: 6. Configuring new system - Rahul Sandhu's Arch Install Docs (at archinstall.sandhuservices.dev)
Dec 07 05:24:53 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg The main reason is because I find it easier to manage. i prefer to have a directory of files with indivudial information, i.e. 000_user1 and so on if you get what I mean. There is no real advantage to it - mostly just preference for managing the system. I would like to note that I do not like to specify the whole wheel group as having sudo
Dec 07 05:24:53 .:oldfashionedcow:.	access, rather specific users as I think that leads to a more secure system.
Dec 07 05:26:03 .:Koragg:.	I mostly use a lengthy youtube video for installing arch, and personally (at least on my own hardware) I am fine giving the whole wheel group sudo privs, and only added my main user to the wheel group. your approach sounds like it would increase security on a vps or such, that others use yeah
Dec 07 05:27:23 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg Yeah, I completly agree - the difference is miniscule. I just do it out of habit - I don't find it that much extra work, and I as I get more into homelab/server stuff, I want to make sure to try and make some good pracitices.
Dec 07 05:27:50 .:slact:.	after a recent update, 2 LVM-on-LUKS arch boxes are having trouble booting. The systemd root-remount service fails because systemd times out waiting for /dev/disk/by-uuid/[root-uuid)
Dec 07 05:28:12 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Is it a systemd bug?
Dec 07 05:28:13 .:Koragg:.	I was not aware of that approach even (rather new to Arch), and in the Packages section, especially for dual-booting, could you add os-prober as an additional component people can use? 
Dec 07 05:28:19 .:slact:.	but if i enter the recovery consile it's already mounted
Dec 07 05:28:39 .:slact:.	and i can actually continue the boot process with the failed unit on one of the machines
Dec 07 05:28:56 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg I use a different bootloader (systemdboot), but I will actually be adding grub to the guide soon, so I will add os-prober :)
Dec 07 05:29:18 .:oldfashionedcow:.	The TPM stuff is really cool. My system takes about 6 seconds to boot with a gui, and yet I can rely on full luks encryption.
Dec 07 05:29:18 .:Koragg:.	oh, os-prober is exclsuively for grub? learned another new thing tonight
Dec 07 05:30:48 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg I think so yeah. Systemdboot is quite a lightweight bootloader and can only boot EFI's of a single boot partition (no multi-drive stuff). I dualboot arch and gentoo, and I use a series of scripts to setup the gentoo EFI in a shared folder on my arch drive. But hey - you are one fact smarter now!
Dec 07 05:32:01 .:Koragg:.	I actually have mine on separate disks even (just to be on the safe side), and will you also cover BIOS vs UEFI partitioning and such? might be interesting for folks (as especially virt-manager only uses BIOS by default apparently)
Dec 07 05:33:17 .:oldfashionedcow:.	I am planning to add BIOS soon too. That is also why I am looking at doing grub, as systemdboot is UEFI only (I think they have some experimental testing, but still not worth it). As for virt-manager, it is for sure possible to add UEFI if you want too.
Dec 07 05:33:33 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Just make sure to customise the machine before install, go to system and select firmware.
Dec 07 05:34:50 .:Koragg:.	I did that once when a youtube video showed me how it is done, but it oddly took a very long time. eventually I aborted it, made another one with legacy/bios, and it was set up much faster
Dec 07 05:34:58 .:Koragg:.	not sure if I was too impatient, or it was actually being buggy
Dec 07 05:35:15 .:bluetail:.	as in, openbios?
Dec 07 05:35:19 .:oldfashionedcow:.	I have a vm with passthrough GPU for messing with custom kernel configs, zfs and many other things. I use UEFI with virt-manager and it works great. I only do that on gentoo though, and I emerge UEFI firmware.
Dec 07 05:35:30 .:oldfashionedcow:.	bluetail I think tianiocore/edk stuff
Dec 07 05:35:55 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg I think there is a package you might need to install. I am not sure what that is for arch though, as I work in docker containers on arch.
Dec 07 05:37:20 .:oldfashionedcow:.	Koragg I do have a feeling though that something was being buggy.

Dec 08 01:22:20 .:iio7:.	So I have this PKGBUILD file from a package. I would like to make some changes to the source before building the package. I do "makepkg --nobuild" and the package is fetched.
