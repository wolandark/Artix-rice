Nov 16 17:26:01 .:puffbar:.	for personal data
Nov 16 17:28:02 .:xwindows:.	Well, there are many kinds of personal data (composed document, photos, finance, classified infos, etc).
Nov 16 17:28:58 .:xwindows:.	And I use different scheme for storing them [for quick retreival] with minimal software requirement.

Nov 16 19:09:12 .:desertmouse:.	umm.. I started using vimwiki for notes recently? The format is simple and although I'm still exploring it, seems better than the notes apps I have tried till now (Joplin, Notable, Obsidian)
Nov 16 19:11:59 .:tomasino:.	are you using the default format or markdown?
Nov 16 19:12:03 .:tomasino:.	i use it via markdown
Nov 16 19:13:40 .:desertmouse:.	tomasino: I'm using the default one for now. The formats can be used interchangeably right? Or do I have to enable markdown? 
Nov 16 19:15:36 .:desertmouse:.	btw, everyone, what's your favorite sci-fi tech asthetic if you have one? I really like the one from Oblivion.
Nov 16 19:35:32 .:konomo:.	bbj, or old-school bbs menus in general

Nov 16 20:10:22 .:tomasino:.	my most recent fav aesthetic is solarpunk, but that's probably because i'm living and breathing it every minute of the day with the podcast
Nov 16 20:11:13 .:tomasino:.	i like realistic future aesthetics, where things are worn and smudged, a little reused... but not decrepit and trashed. the way they've been handling the vibe in Andor has been great
Nov 16 22:31:44 .:Dr-WaSabi:.	ugh.. hackintech can't you keep this weather over on your side of the lake? https://ttm.sh/0LC.png
