Nov 16 23:06:55 .:jb1277976:.	Is there any point of having an external monitor for a laptop running i3 when i have 9 virtual desktops that can run whatever i want? just want to see the need for an external monitor. i would like one but i don't see if its even needed
Nov 16 23:13:45 .:nimaje:.	a second monitor would mean more screen space, so more you can see at once, if you have use for that is something you have to decide yourself and you can have as many workspaces as you want
Nov 16 23:14:43 .:nimaje:.	why do you ask basically the same question here and in #suckless?
Nov 16 23:42:53 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Hi, in my i3 config I have `bindsym $mod+w exec "rofi -show windowcd"` and `bindsym $mod+e exec "rofi -show window"` respectively. That was fine for rofi 1.5.0 but apparently not for the current rofi stable release. On the latest stable, `windowcd` has same behavior as `window` (meaning, in both cases I get to see windows across all workspaces). Initiating `rofi -show windowcd` via terminal works as expected though. Did anyone else have this
Nov 16 23:42:53 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	issue?

Nov 17 10:38:40 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: Yes, I experience the same with rofi 1.7.3
Nov 17 12:26:40 .:af:.	Hi, I am trying to bind something to $mod+button3 but it never executes. I have verified with xev that button 3 is triggered. Instead, i3 just snaps the pointer to the nearest window edge whenever I hit $mod+button3. Any ideas?
Nov 17 12:27:34 .:af:.	(which by the way I think is a nice feature, but I still need my binding though)
Nov 17 12:32:06 .:okraits:.	af: Please post your exact config line
Nov 17 12:35:49 .:okraits:.	af: if you want it to work anywhere over a window, you need to specify '--border --whole-window'

Nov 17 13:13:13 .:okraits:.	Sorry
Nov 17 13:18:29 .:af:.	okraits: Ahh, adding --border made it work. Thank you! I'll re-read the docs to understand this now.

Nov 17 13:48:06 .:okraits:.	af: You're welcome :)
Nov 17 13:48:19 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	@okraits: What version of i3 are you running it from? Check out a similar issue and what that user did to fix it: https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/1539
Nov 17 13:48:47 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Also, to what key combo did you bind `rofi -show windowcd` to?
Nov 17 13:51:01 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: $mod+x, 4.21-125-ga1e4b449
Nov 17 13:51:35 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	So `bindsym $mod+x exec "rofi -show windowcd"` ?
Nov 17 13:52:23 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: yes, but without the double quotes
Nov 17 13:52:36 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Ah ok.
Nov 17 13:52:59 .:okraits:.	it also shows windows from all workspaces if I run it from rofi itself. But it works if I run it from a terminal
Nov 17 13:53:30 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Yeah same here from terminal. Really weird. What distro are you on?
Nov 17 13:53:47 .:okraits:.	Debian Bullseye
Nov 17 13:54:05 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	I'm on 22.04 (VM for now)
Nov 17 13:55:19 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	I'm in #rofi:libera.chat right now trying to provide more info and hopefully narrow it down further.
Nov 17 14:00:16 .:okraits:.	Yeah, strange issue
Nov 17 14:25:23 .:woland:.	does rofi also take a few seconds to launch the first time for you too?
Nov 17 14:28:09 <okraits>	woland: first time after boot or what do you mean?
Nov 17 14:29:04 .:woland:.	yes first time as in first time after boot
Nov 17 14:29:32 .:okraits:.	I don't know, I would have to reboot to try :)
Nov 17 14:29:57 .:woland:.	had to switch to albert just because of this issue 
Nov 17 14:29:58 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	@okraits: Try adding `--no-startup-id` after exec.
Nov 17 14:30:07 .:woland:.	ForeverNoob[m]:  I have
Nov 17 14:30:31 <okraits>	woland: which issue? startup time?
Nov 17 14:30:37 .:woland:.	yea
Nov 17 14:30:41 <ForeverNoob[m]>	@woland: Was not referring to you :)
Nov 17 14:30:52 .:woland:.	ForeverNoob[m]: my bad
Nov 17 14:31:27 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: to fix the windowcd mode?
Nov 17 14:31:55 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Yes
Nov 17 14:32:23 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Actual fix has just been added, so you might also test that: https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/commit/c82754307cd160e692b0892490849c11849f9ce4
Nov 17 14:32:49 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: Oh nice :)
Nov 17 14:33:19 <okraits>	woland: This guy uses fzf in a terminal as a replacement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw2mnwhptjw
Nov 17 14:34:18 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Maintainer says that it might not be a 100% fix lol, so I guess we'll have to see Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
Nov 17 14:34:30 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	But I'm glad it got patched so quickly.
Nov 17 14:36:37 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	@okraits: Re: fzf replacemtn. I've been working on that for quite a while now, but the fundamental roadblock is that i3 does not allow floating windows to spawn on top of fullscreen windows like rofi does atm: https://github.com/i3/i3/discussions/5263
Nov 17 14:37:15 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	...and Alacritty is unable to handle input / etc when direct_override is applied to it.
Nov 17 14:37:31 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: Ah, I remember that issue
Nov 17 14:37:42 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: But do you have fullscreen windows so often?
Nov 17 14:38:29 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	The main alacritty window I'm working in (running the main tmux session) is always fullscreen.
Nov 17 14:38:30 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: Oh, I already posted the video link in the original issue...
Nov 17 14:38:38 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	:D
Nov 17 14:38:58 .:woland:.	okraits: thats interesting
Nov 17 14:39:20 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: And hiding window decorations and the bar is not an alternative to fullscreen?
Nov 17 14:39:53 .:woland:.	rofi -show windowcd launches immediately but only shows windows in the workspace in which its launched not all open windows
Nov 17 14:40:13 <okraits>	woland: that's intended
Nov 17 14:40:36 .:woland:.	okraits: no work around then?
Nov 17 14:40:37 <ForeverNoob[m]>	@woland: Use `rofi -show window` for that.
Nov 17 14:40:41 .:okraits:.	windowcd = window current desktop
Nov 17 14:41:05 .:woland:.	okraits: ah!
Nov 17 14:41:12 <okraits>	woland: The issue was that it shows windows from all workspaces when launched by i3
Nov 17 14:41:23 .:woland:.	ForeverNoob[m]: Thanks 
Nov 17 14:42:02 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	@okraits: That might be a solution for that main alacritty session, but not for other fullscreen windows that I occasionally have. Though I could try and replicate a faux-fullscreen (but then at that point it gets to be hacky really quickly)
Nov 17 14:43:08 .:okraits:.	ForeverNoob[m]: yeah, but it's an option at least
Nov 17 14:43:27 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Yeah I suppose.
Nov 17 14:44:24 .:okraits:.	Or maybe it's possible to disable fullscreen, start your launcher, enable fullscreen again
Nov 17 14:45:33 .:okraits:.	or in reality: get the fullscreen state (enabled or disabled), start your launcher, restore the fullscreen state
Nov 17 14:56:04 .:okraits:.	Lunchtime
Nov 17 15:13:19 .:nimaje:.	how about using tabbed layout, ForeverNoob[m]?
Nov 17 15:14:41 .:woland:.	tabbed with font set to 0 is best
Nov 17 18:01:47 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	@nimaje: Oh I'm using tabbed layout on a couple of workspaces already, it's just that for some windows I prefer fullscreen. Especially for apps that maximize all the available screen real estate (in my case that being Bitwig Studio to name one from the top of my head). And with a resolution of 1366 x 768, screen real estate is definitely an asset :p
Nov 17 18:08:43 .:woland:.	ForeverNoob[m]: this is how I use reaper DAW in i3
Nov 17 18:08:46 .:woland:.	for_window [class="REAPER" instance="REAPER"] floating enable , border normal 2
Nov 17 18:09:07 .:woland:.	maybe its useful to you
Nov 17 18:09:37 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	How do you manage its x/y placement though, manually?
Nov 17 18:10:17 .:woland:.	it just spawns the dialogues (like eq or something) in the middle of the screen in floating mode
Nov 17 18:10:26 .:woland:.	I can drag them around ofcourse
Nov 17 18:10:51 .:woland:.	and if they spawn in the wrong display you can also specify an output for its class
Nov 17 18:12:19 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	What about spawning the main window though? Because if I make some windows floating, I have to manually resize them to my liking.
Nov 17 18:12:53 .:woland:.	the main window spawns full screen for me by default 
Nov 17 18:13:07 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Ah I see.
Nov 17 18:13:24 .:woland:.	you specify size tho in i3 config
Nov 17 18:13:35 .:woland:.	like this "resize set 1904 400, move position 1929px 681px"
Nov 17 18:14:02 .:woland:.	you can use this syntax after the launch command or the class command
Nov 17 18:14:59 .:ForeverNoob[m]:.	Yeah I have a special resize mode where I hit a key and it applies the size and x/y to windows. I could try making such customization for Bitwig Studio.
Nov 17 18:15:30 .:woland:.	certainly 
Nov 17 18:36:43 .:okraits:.	I wouldn't use floating windows for long existing windows
Nov 17 18:37:18 .:okraits:.	Rather use tabbed layout and remove borders or even titles by setting the font size to 0 if needed

Nov 18 15:37:50 .:kuhilas[m]:.	exec --no-startup-id 'workspace 2; exec qutebrowser; workspace 3; exec qutebrowser;'
Nov 18 15:37:57 .:kuhilas[m]:.	You mean this should do the same thing?
Nov 18 15:38:01 .:kuhilas[m]:.	in config
Nov 18 15:38:09 .:woland:.	it should
Nov 18 15:38:27 .:woland:.	but move to workspace 2
Nov 18 15:38:32 .:woland:.	should be better
Nov 18 15:39:31 .:woland:.	I've never ran two instances of the same program tho. terminals that accept assigned class can do this easily but idk about qutebrowser. I auto start mine in ws1 and thats it for me
Nov 18 15:40:06 .:kuhilas[m]:.	it doesn't work without i3-msg for me
Nov 18 15:40:09 .:kuhilas[m]:.	just tried
Nov 18 15:40:28 .:woland:.	did you login?
Nov 18 15:40:32 .:kuhilas[m]:.	I have actually also assigned classes for qutebrowser too where the 2nd instance gets moved automatically
Nov 18 15:40:38 .:kuhilas[m]:.	I reloaded with ctrl-r
Nov 18 15:40:53 .:woland:.	you have to log out and log back in again to make sure
Nov 18 15:41:07 .:woland:.	or startx from another tty if you can
Nov 18 15:41:28 .:kuhilas[m]:.	hmm actually that old assigning messes things up a bit, I forgot I had that
Nov 18 15:43:54 .:woland:.	if you have classes assigned to qutebrowser just assign each class to a different workspace
Nov 18 15:44:17 .:woland:.	with for_window class syntax that I sent b4
Nov 18 15:56:55 .:kuhilas[m]:.	thanks got it working now
Nov 18 16:16:15 .:woland:.	kuhilas[m]: anytime

Dec 07 23:49:55 .:merskot:.	I have a weird problem with an external monitor I occasionally use with my laptop: after suspending and waking up, it still shows up in xrandr, but it remains dark. When I reboot, it works fine until I suspend again. I'm not absolutely sure that it is a problem with i3, but it works flawlessly with xfce. When the screen is just locked with i3lock, it works too, so it must be an issue with the suspend somehow. Does anyone have an idea, even just about which p
Dec 07 23:49:56 .:merskot:.	y system might be causing this?
