T 1668519730 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	no, because vim deals with characters
T 1668519821 28.:192427otisolsen7028:.	So not sure why finding the bytes in a hexeditor would help.
T 1668519824 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	you can search for a specific character using \%x12, or \%u1234, or \%U12345678

T 1668519918 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	the difference is 0x85 might be in the UTF-8 representation of a particular character 'Ä', but searching for /\%x85 will not let you find Ä in Vim
T 1668519919 28.:192427otisolsen7028:.	Seems like it
T 1668519957 28.:192427otisolsen7028:.	Ah. I see. So in UTF8 a character might be several bytes. And specifying the byte might only match part of a char?
T 1668519983 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	vim can't do partial matches on a single character
T 1668520005 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	tl;dr a hex editor is useless if you want to find specific weird characters in vim

T 1668520356 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	line drawing becoming triplets of high chars is a sign you have UTF-8 misinterpreted as some 8-bit encoding (latin1 traditioally)

T 1668520477 28.:192429mgedmin28:.	vim usually detects UTF-8 very nicely, but it might refuse to do that if you have a file with an ill-formed (e.g. truncated) UTF-8 character
