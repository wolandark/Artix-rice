T 1668598433 28.:192420Czernobog28:.	uefi searchs for grub and grub searches for OS.
T 1668598478 28.:192425silv3r_m00n28:.	Czernobog: i think grub sits parallel to windows inside EFI system partition
T 1668598480 28.:192425live128:.	silv3r_m00n: No. GRUB2 is the bootloader which will have _all_ OS (bootable) entries. UEFI is lower level - it's like BIOS. GRUB is one abstraction level upwards, a bootloader. UEFI would be the motherboard initialization system/hardware control and such.
T 1668598485 28.:192425silv3r_m00n28:.	so ideally UEFI could trigger windows as well
T 1668598516 28.:192425live128:.	GRUB2 could be used with Windows only, and is not tied to any OS (be it Ubuntu, or other)
T 1668598524 28.:192429X728:.	Unless you're on slackware, that uses LILO/ELILO by default.
T 1668598534 28.:192420Czernobog28:.	uefi is a firmware which is installed on your computer's motherboard. It does the POST test and searches for grub which in turn searches for the OS
T 1668598561 28.:192425live128:.	If you are seeing 'Windows' entry and 'Ubuntu' one, and both work, that's it. Lots of folks dual booting have the same setup, and that setup that you are mentioning (GRUB2 bootloader) is the default.
T 1668598600 28.:192425silv3r_m00n28:.	wait let me check

T 1668598674 28.:192425live128:.	So, to answer your question. No. There shouldn't be an UEFI boot menu, as GRUB2 is the default "boot menu". UEFI is a lower apstraction, a motherboard firmware.

T 1668598877 28.:192427oerheks28:.	os prober is disabled, so there is no windows in grub menu
T 1668598884 28.:192425silv3r_m00n28:.	this means that GRUB and Windows Loader are sitting side by side, just that GRUB lets access to windows, while windows does not let access to ubuntu

T 1668598997 28.:192425live128:.	Hmm, what do you mean by 'side to side'? Windows has it's own default boot program, tied to the OS. Just as Linux does, but not tied. What is the expected/desired result silv3r_m00n?

T 1668688245 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	How much / changes also depends on how many other partitions you have... /usr /home /var etc will make / vary less.

T 1668688257 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	(not /etc.  /etc needs to be in /)
T 1668688273 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	I did not say /etc but yes that was unintentionaly misleading
T 1668688279 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	I know.  heh

T 1668688456 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	Some distros don't want /usr separate anymore
T 1668688466 28.:192420RedCrow28:.	Can I log in to my linux edition through an USB stick and manually edit the partition?
T 1668688499 28.:192420RedCrow28:.	*Linux
T 1668688521 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	There are live gedit iso's etc, sure, you can do that.  If you can.
T 1668688522 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Well, there's not a lot of utility in keeping /usr separate from / unless you're trying to like, use one common /usr among a bunch of virtuals
T 1668688558 28.:192420RedCrow28:.	I mean obviously I can't edit the root partition while it is active, right?
T 1668688571 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Under certain circumstances you can
T 1668688587 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Like, if your'e using LVM and you're enlarging it... that's trivial
T 1668688606 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Moving the start of it or shrinking it... definitely not to be done online
T 1668688611 28.:192420RedCrow28:.	Thus without a LVM my task is impossible?
T 1668688650 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Without LVM most of hte same restrictions apply.  If you're enlarging it by moving the end, it's fine, it just needs you to slap the kernel with partprobe/kpartx after editing the partition table
T 1668688680 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Not that many people have free contiguous space on the disk following their root filesystem tho
T 1668688899 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	is there a tool that can find duplicate files and then combine the filenames of all the dupes into one?
T 1668688920 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	e.g. if you had a b and c with the same contents, it would replace those files with abc
T 1668688928 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	symlink them all to one or something?
T 1668688930 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	or maybe "a; b; c"
T 1668688932 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	List them, yes.  Destroy them, yes.  Anything else is up to you.
T 1668688948 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	find_duplicates is a common tool for finding
T 1668688956 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	yeah i used fdupes to make a list
T 1668688978 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	and i'm writing the combining logic in python, but i was wondering if there was a quicker solution
T 1668688983 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	Oops yes fdupes
T 1668689021 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	but sounds like you need some very specialized thing, so you'll have to wrap around fdupes most likely.
T 1668689043 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	yeah
T 1668689175 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	If you intend to write to these files in the future, this might be a bad idea
T 1668689185 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Changing one will change all the duplicates as well after you do this
T 1668689204 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	If this is basically a bunch of read-only files on the same filesystem, then you can just use hardlinks
T 1668689235 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	well i don't want to use symlinks/hardlinks
T 1668689238 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Having written a deduplicator of my own, fdupes is f**king fast
T 1668689246 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	i just want to rename a to abc, and then delete b and c
T 1668689267 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	I wish it could exclude file extensions..
T 1668689306 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	Hopefully you won't run into problems with filename lengths, because this sounds like another case of "Mistakenly treating a filesystem like a database"
T 1668689350 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	i think i already ran into that issue
T 1668689371 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	so yeah, i guess a better aproach would be to just remove dupes and have a txt file
T 1668689391 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	i.e. a txt file with the output of fdupes
T 1668689410 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	...or to just store it all in a database to begin with
T 1668689414 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	SQL ain't that hard
T 1668689437 28.:192424Dagmar28:.	(although it's definitely homely)
T 1668689468 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	well i'm working with the output of a program that just spits out some files
T 1668689483 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	but yeah database could work instead of txt
T 1668689496 28.:192424HiccupJul28:.	although its for a static website so txt (or html) is probably best
T 1668689588 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	Wouldn't you just nuke the old output if it's a static website generator
T 1668690328 28.:192425live128:.	sometimes it feels like my OS is being virtualized. think it's due to the powerful hardware and the OS "barely touching it". using openbox only, cpu runs mostly at lower freq, hardly every fill out more than half or RAM space.
T 1668690363 28.:192426scarf28:.	Every intel processor post 2007 has an embedded minix OS in it.
T 1668690431 28.:192426scarf28:.	I guess you could say that unix really won the OS wars. Because literally everyone is running unix in a subtle way.
T 1668690461 28.:192425live128:.	that is my second guess, naturally one thinks that "they'll" virtualize all free OSes. but, heh, that' me utter _s-it_. screw the privacy thing, i want _real_ performance, _real_ instruction execution, not virtualized.
T 1668690715 28.:192426scarf28:.	live1, what are you doing that you need full pedal to the metal?

T 1668690870 28.:192425live128:.	i'm doing normal programming work. the idea of the OS being virtualized is utter nonsense. computers don't work that way, i don't want an emulation layer in between the hardware and my OS.
T 1668690900 28.:192426scarf28:.	I'm afraid there is nothing you can do about it other than run hardware from 2005.
T 1668690964 28.:192425live128:.	suspecting Windows is having standard hardware access, as it's closed source. but this is pure s-it. alternatives are thinkpads or coreboot/libreboot supported hardware. alternative also is me_cleaner.
T 1668690979 28.:192425live128:.	but at this point, this is all assumption.
T 1668691031 28.:192425live128:.	it'd be a fun research topic.
T 1668691034 28.:192426scarf28:.	I think windows enforces emulation layers, it's not the DOS era anymore to where you can run your i386 in real mode.
T 1668691177 28.:192425live128:.	i'm refering to modern hardware and windows in that context.

T 1668691200 28.:192426scarf28:.	Who knows what's going on behind the scenes with modern intel chips. You literally have a 2nd OS running under the hood.
T 1668691206 28.:192425live128:.	eg. it's closed source so it can have direct access to the hardware, without any kind of (suspected) virtualization or emulation.

T 1668691395 28.:192425live128:.	privacy/spying would be the secondary issue. main problem is _my_ OS being virtualized! ah. well...
T 1668691435 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	Your OS is not virtualized, why do you keep saying that
T 1668691524 28.:192425live128:.	it is an assumption. we were talking about intel ME and such.
T 1668691538 28.:192426Khaytsus28:.	there's #Linux-offtopic for..  random nonsense.  Just saying.
