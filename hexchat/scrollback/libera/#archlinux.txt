T 1668646935 28.:192427Namarrgon28:.	Fergorn: you don't have to, snapshots are useful even if not used for backups

T 1668647034 28.:192428Guimauve28:.	Fergorn - it is. snapshot a base install into new directories for each VM/container, and until they change those files they will all point to the same actual data on disk. 
T 1668647100 28.:192428Guimauve28:.	Fergorn - you could have a hundred containers running and only use marginally more disk space than one if all they have is a few configuration changes and the app you have containerized

T 1668647637 28.:192428Guimauve28:.	freebsd isn't bad. and the whole thing is built with clang, which i think is neat. as far as i know, neither glibc nor the kernel will currently build with clang (clarification: not ALL of the kernel, even if you manage to build your personal config)
T 1668647671 28.:192424Fergorn28:.	some people on gentoo did build the kernel with clang i think but its generally unsupported
T 1668647727 28.:192428Guimauve28:.	Fergorn - back on topic though, i'd suggest btrfs over zfs for linux

T 1668648032 28.:192424Fergorn28:.	also how does arch manage build time options? do they build the most common options into the main package, and the rest are split? and does this happen for everything or will i be forced to manually build packages if i want something not included?
T 1668648040 28.:192427Namarrgon28:.	writing times is a bit more effort than adding a single line to crontab

T 1668648164 28.:192428Guimauve28:.	Fergorn - before you get into installing on btrfs, just a heads up, make a subvolume for anything you DONT want to be in your snapshots. even if you don't actually care for any other reason. you might want /var/log as a @var_log subvolume, for example, so that your logs aren't part of your root filesystem snapshots. 
T 1668648175 28.:192424Fergorn28:.	everything into one package? i thought it used package spliting as debian. like package-main package-main-featureA etc

T 1670377694 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Its a wip, I am yet to setup btrbk, but I think it is pretty solid so far.
T 1670377740 28.:192425bluetail28:.	I like it. But I don't think the archwiki can take such information
T 1670377803 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Yeah, I basically wanted a reference for myself, and thought it would be cool to put it out there. I just thought I would run it here in case anyone has any thoughts or opinons on my setup process.
T 1670377986 28.:192419Koragg28:.	oldfashionedcow: I have a question regarding https://archinstall.sandhuservices.dev/configuring_new_system/ - why do you not make use of visudo ? is the option you use like a more modern or more secure approach?
T 1670377988 28.:192422phrik28:.	Title: 6. Configuring new system - Rahul Sandhu's Arch Install Docs (at archinstall.sandhuservices.dev)
T 1670378093 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg The main reason is because I find it easier to manage. i prefer to have a directory of files with indivudial information, i.e. 000_user1 and so on if you get what I mean. There is no real advantage to it - mostly just preference for managing the system. I would like to note that I do not like to specify the whole wheel group as having sudo
T 1670378093 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	access, rather specific users as I think that leads to a more secure system.
T 1670378163 28.:192419Koragg28:.	I mostly use a lengthy youtube video for installing arch, and personally (at least on my own hardware) I am fine giving the whole wheel group sudo privs, and only added my main user to the wheel group. your approach sounds like it would increase security on a vps or such, that others use yeah
T 1670378243 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg Yeah, I completly agree - the difference is miniscule. I just do it out of habit - I don't find it that much extra work, and I as I get more into homelab/server stuff, I want to make sure to try and make some good pracitices.
T 1670378270 28.:192425slact28:.	after a recent update, 2 LVM-on-LUKS arch boxes are having trouble booting. The systemd root-remount service fails because systemd times out waiting for /dev/disk/by-uuid/[root-uuid)
T 1670378292 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Is it a systemd bug?
T 1670378293 28.:192419Koragg28:.	I was not aware of that approach even (rather new to Arch), and in the Packages section, especially for dual-booting, could you add os-prober as an additional component people can use? 
T 1670378299 28.:192425slact28:.	but if i enter the recovery consile it's already mounted
T 1670378319 28.:192425slact28:.	and i can actually continue the boot process with the failed unit on one of the machines
T 1670378336 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg I use a different bootloader (systemdboot), but I will actually be adding grub to the guide soon, so I will add os-prober :)
T 1670378358 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	The TPM stuff is really cool. My system takes about 6 seconds to boot with a gui, and yet I can rely on full luks encryption.
T 1670378358 28.:192419Koragg28:.	oh, os-prober is exclsuively for grub? learned another new thing tonight
T 1670378448 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg I think so yeah. Systemdboot is quite a lightweight bootloader and can only boot EFI's of a single boot partition (no multi-drive stuff). I dualboot arch and gentoo, and I use a series of scripts to setup the gentoo EFI in a shared folder on my arch drive. But hey - you are one fact smarter now!
T 1670378521 28.:192419Koragg28:.	I actually have mine on separate disks even (just to be on the safe side), and will you also cover BIOS vs UEFI partitioning and such? might be interesting for folks (as especially virt-manager only uses BIOS by default apparently)
T 1670378597 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	I am planning to add BIOS soon too. That is also why I am looking at doing grub, as systemdboot is UEFI only (I think they have some experimental testing, but still not worth it). As for virt-manager, it is for sure possible to add UEFI if you want too.
T 1670378613 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Just make sure to customise the machine before install, go to system and select firmware.
T 1670378690 28.:192419Koragg28:.	I did that once when a youtube video showed me how it is done, but it oddly took a very long time. eventually I aborted it, made another one with legacy/bios, and it was set up much faster
T 1670378698 28.:192419Koragg28:.	not sure if I was too impatient, or it was actually being buggy
T 1670378715 28.:192425bluetail28:.	as in, openbios?
T 1670378719 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	I have a vm with passthrough GPU for messing with custom kernel configs, zfs and many other things. I use UEFI with virt-manager and it works great. I only do that on gentoo though, and I emerge UEFI firmware.
T 1670378730 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	bluetail I think tianiocore/edk stuff
T 1670378755 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg I think there is a package you might need to install. I am not sure what that is for arch though, as I work in docker containers on arch.
T 1670378840 28.:192419oldfashionedcow28:.	Koragg I do have a feeling though that something was being buggy.
