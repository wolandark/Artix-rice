T 1670507469 19.:2823woland19:.	the browser launches with "ERROR: Renderer process crashed (status 31)" and doesnt render anything except for a white page
T 1670507480 19.:2823woland19:.	OS is Arch
T 1670507876 04<The-Compiler04>04	woland: the QtWebEngine coming with a virtualenv install is too old to run properly on Arch. Why not install via the Arch package?
T 1670507635 19.:2823woland19:.	because it just broke. complaining about missing qtwebengine even though it is installed and qutebrowser was running fine until two hours ago.
T 1670507676 19.:2823woland19:.	I've been searching everywhere and trying everything to fix it but nothing worked
T 1670508031 19.:2823woland19:.	http://0x0.st/od1r.txt here is the error from official arch repo, same goes for qutebrowser-git from aur and also the qt6 version

T 1670508875 19.:2823woland19:.	how can I unset QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS='-blink-settings=darkModeEnabled=tlayScrollbarFlashWhenMouseEnter ? and what does "Consider using the qt.args qutebrowser setting instead" mean?
T 1670508909 19.:2823woland19:.	I really cant switch to another browser, qutebrowser is perfect, any help is much appreciated

T 1670509870 28.:192428nimaje28:.	which of them? the only explanation for that error message that I have is that libre2 got rebuild and changed SOABI, but qt-webengine wasn't rebuild as it should then
T 1670509579 19.:2823woland19:.	I specifically saw qt-webengine I dont think that I saw libre2 upgrading
T 1670509639 19.:2823woland19:.	whats the full name of libre2?
T 1670509680 19.:2823woland19:.	i think its re2 on arch

T 1670510506 28.:192428nimaje28:.	does it for some reason try to use some other qt-webengine?

T 1670552258 04<The-Compiler04>04	woland: Judging from the second error you posted, you have a second PyQt5/Qt installation in your home: "QtWebKit: cannot import name 'QtWebKit' from 'PyQt5' (/home/woland/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PyQt5/__init__.py)". I'd try a "pip uninstall PyQt5" to get rid of that. (This message has been postponed on 2022-12-08 18:07:00.)
T 1670551982 19.:2823woland19:.	The-Compiler: I did remove the packages I had stupidly installed from pip based on a similar comment of yours on reddit.
T 1670552159 19.:2823woland19:.	the problem is solved now, I just upgraded qt5-webengine 5.15.11-3 and qt6-webengine 6.4.1-2 and reinstalled qutebrowser from the official repos which pulled python-pyqt5-webengine 5.15.6-1
T 1670552174 19.:2823woland19:.	my fav browser is back to normal now :)
