T 1668649996 28.:192429buu28:.	Not exactly, you generally want a "backing object" that stores all the values currently contained in your form fields
T 1668650042 28.:192429buu28:.	Obviously this isn't exactly required but it's generally easier to have your UI, in this case the input fields, reflect your data object, rather than vice versa
T 1668650098 28.:192429buu28:.	In very broad terms, you say something like let mydata ={field1: 42}; then you tell react that mydata.field1 should be the value that input id=field1 shows
T 1668650121 28.:192429buu28:.	Then when you want to submit the data, you just have to look at what is currently in mydata

T 1668650191 28.:192429buu28:.	A slightly more useful example is if you want a field to only allow numbers in it, and you want it stored in `mydata.numberfield`, you don't want `.numberfield` to ever contain a letter, so you write an onchange listener that checks the new current value of your input field and if it contains a letter you revert to whatever is currently in `mydata.numberfield`

T 1668667508 28.:192420blahboybaz28:.	KevinX: I'm not sure how react handles it. I was taking a basic approach just using native html elements and what's getting stored is the cumulation of each new character as it is added (rather than the final result).. Maybe I didn't choose the best way to implement what I'm doing. I was just screwing around trying to learn some new stuff and just cooking up ridiculous ideas to try. That being said
T 1668667514 28.:192420blahboybaz28:.	I guess I'm stubborn. I kinda want to see if I can get this to work with what I have going on an put this bitch to rest forever.

T 1668667515 28.:19@2427ljharb28:.	jazzy: because event handlers shouldn't return a value. so you want `() => { setPage(pageNum); }`
T 1668667530 28.:19@2427ljharb28:.	jazzy: also use String(x) instead of x.toString()
